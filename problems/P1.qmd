This is Problem Sheet 1, which covers material from Lectures 1 to 6. You should work through all the questions on this problem sheet in advance of the problems class, which takes place in the lecture of **Thursday 16 October**. If you are stuck on any of the questions, you are welcome to discuss them with me in my office hours on Thursdays at 1300.

This problem sheet is to help you practice material from the module and to help you check your learning. It is *not* for formal assessment and does not count towards your module mark.

However, if, optionally, you would like some brief informal feedback on **Questions 4, 6 and 8** (marked â˜…), I am happy to provide some. If you want some brief feedback, you should submit your work electronically through Gradescope via the module's Minerva page by **1400 on Tuesday 14 October**. I will return some brief comments on your those two questions by the problems class on Thursday 16 October. Because this informal feedback, not part of the official assessment, I cannot accept late work for any reason -- but I am always happy to discuss any of your work on any question in my office hours.

Many of these questions will require use of the [R programming language](https://cran.r-project.org) (for example, by using the [program RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/)).

Full solutions should be released on Friday 17 October.
