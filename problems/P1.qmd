Basic MC example


Let $X$ be a random variable, and let $\Ind_A$ and $\Ind_B$ be two indicator functions.

(a) What is the expected value of $\Ind_A(X) \times \Ind_B(X)$?

(b) Show that the covariance $\Cov(\Ind_A(X), \Ind_B(A)$ is zero if and only if the events $\{X \in A\}$ and $\{X \in B\}$ are independent.
