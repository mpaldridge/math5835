This is Problem Sheet 1, which covers material from Lectures 1 to 6. You should work through all the questions on this problem sheet in advance of the problems class, which takes place in the lecture of **Thursday 17 October**.

This problem sheet is to help you practice material from the module. It is not for assessment and will not be marked. However, you can get feedback on your work by (a) being well prepared for the problems class, by making attempts at all questions in advance; (b) speaking up in the problems class, asking for clarification where things aren't clear and offering ideas on how to solve the questions; (c) discussing your work with colleagues and friends; (d) coming along to my office hours on Mondays at 1500.

Many of these questions will require use of the [R programming language](https://cran.r-project.org) (for example, by using the [program RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/)).

**1.**      Let $X$ be uniform on $[-1,2]$.

:::: {.subq}
**(a)**   By hand, calculate the exact value of $\Ex X^4$.
::::

:::: {.subq}
**(b)**   Using R, calculate a Monte Carlo estimate for $\Ex X^4$.
::::
:::::

:::: {.myq}
**2.**      Let $X$ and $Y$ both be standard normal distributions. Compute a Monte Carlo estimate of $\Exg \max\{X,Y\}$. (You may wish to investigate R's `pmax()` function.)

::::: {.myq}
**3.**      You are trapped alone on an island. All you have with you is a tin can (radius $r$) and a cardboard box (side lengths $2r \times 2r$) that it fits snugly inside. You put the can inside the box [left picture].

When it starts raining, each raindrop that falls in the cardboard box might fall into the tin can [middle picture], or might fall into the corners of the box outside the can [right picture].

:::: {.subq}
**(a)**   Using R, simulate rainfall into the box. You may take units such that $r = 1$. Estimate the probability $\theta$ that a uniformly-random raindrop that falls in the cardboard box falls into the tin can also.

:::: {.subq}
**(b)**   Calculate exactly the probability $\theta$.
::::

:::: {.subq}
**(c)**   You realise that, despite being trapped all alone on the island, you now have a way of approximating the value of $\pi$. If you want to calculate $\pi$ to 6 decimal places, roughly how many raindrops do you need to fall into the box?

**4.**      Let $f(x) = 1/(x + 0.1)$. We wish to estimate $\int_0^5 f(x) \, \mathrm{d}x$ using a Monte Carlo method.

:::: {.subq}
**(a)**   Estimate the integral using $X$ uniform on $[0,5]$.
::::

:::: {.subq}
**(b)**   Can you come up with a choice of $X$ that improves on the estimate from (a)?
::::
:::::

:::: {.myq}
**5.**      When $n$ is very large, one might wish to store all $n$ samples $x_i$ before calculating the Monte Carlo estimate $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \phi(x_i)$. However, this uses up a lot of space in a computer's memory. Describe (in words, in R code, or in a mixture of the two) how the Monte Carlo estimate could be produced using much less memory.

:::: {.myq}
**6.**      Show that the indicator functions $\mathbb I_A(X)$ and $\mathbb I_B(X)$ have covariance 0 if and only if the events $\{X \in A\}$ and $\{X \in B\}$ are independent.

::::: {.myq}
**7.**      Let $X$ be an exponential distribution with rate 1.

:::: {.subq}
**(a)**   Estimate $\mathbb EX^{2.1}$ using the standard Monte Carlo method
::::

:::: {.subq}
**(b)**   Estimate $\mathbb EX^{2.1}$ using $X^2$ as a control variate. (You may recall that if $Y$ is exponential with rate $\lambda$, then $\mathbb EY^2 = 2/\lambda^2$.)
::::

:::: {.subq}
**(c)**   Which method is better?
::::
:::::

:::: {.myq}
**8.**      Let $Z$ be a standard normal distribution. A statistician has been investigating estimates of $\mathbb EZ^k$ for different positive integers values of $k$. Her colleague suggests using $Z' = -Z$ as an antithetic variables. Without running any R code, explain whether or not this is a good idea **(a)** when $k$ is even; **(b)** when $k$ is odd.
