**1.**     The Gamma distribution $X \sim \Gamma(m, \lambda)$ has PDF $$ f(x) = \frac{\lambda^m}{(m-1)!} \,x^{m-1}\,\mathrm{e}^{-\lambda x} . $$ \[**Correction:** *There was a typo in this PDF earlier.*\] (This PDF can be evaluated with the `dgamma()` function in R.) The time between eruptions of a volcano, measured in years, is modelled as $X \sim \Gamma(5, \theta)$, IID over eruptions, where $\theta$ is unknown. A scientist beliefs about $\theta$ are represented in a prior distribution $\theta \sim \operatorname{Exp}(6)$.

The following times between eruptions are available in the historical record:

```         
       56.55,  2.57, 29.97, 10.27,  4.32, 17.91, 51.98,  7.06, 11.40, 54.80

            Sample from the posterior distribution for $\theta$, using the random walk Metropolis algorithm. Explain how you chose the stepsize for your algorithm and how you checked it was a good choice.

Draw a histogram of the posterior distribution, and comment on how it differs from the prior.

::: myanswers
*Solution.* The posterior distribution is $$ \pi(\theta \mid \mathbf x) \propto 6\mathrm{e}^{-6\theta} \times \prod_{i=1}^{10} x_i^{4} \, \mathrm{e}^{-\theta x_i} . $$

The code for the Metropolis random walk algorithm will be the following.

```{r}
x <- c(56.55,  2.57, 29.97, 10.27,  4.32,
       17.91, 51.98,  7.06, 11.40, 54.80)

prior <- function(theta) dexp(theta, 6)
like  <- function(theta) prod(dgamma(x, 5, theta))
post  <- function(theta) prior(theta) * like(theta)

accept <- function(curr, prop) post(prop) / post(curr)
initial <- 1
n <- 1e5
sigma <- 0.25

MRW <- rep(0, n)
MRW[1] <- initial
for (i in 1:(n - 1)) {
  prop <- MRW[i] + rnorm(1, 0, sigma)
  if (prop < 0)                             MRW[i + 1] <- MRW[i]
  else if (runif(1) < accept(MRW[i], prop)) MRW[i + 1] <- prop
  else                                      MRW[i + 1] <- MRW[i]
}

hist(MRW[-(1:99)], probability = TRUE, xlim = c(0, 0.5))
curve(prior, add = TRUE, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
```

A little experimentation suggested $\sigma = 0.2$ worked about right -- $\sigma = 0.5$ rejected too many changes. With my initial start point of 1, I found a short burn-in period was necessary, so my histogram starts with the 100th step of the random walk. (I could have just started from 0.2 instead, I suppose.)

We see that while the prior though any number between 0 and $\tfrac12$, maybe even more, was plausible for $\theta$, we can see the prior has become concentrated in the interval $[0.11, 0.32]$ or so, with values around 0.2 the most common. The posterior variance is much smaller than the prior, so we have gained certainty from the results.

**2.**     *\[2019 exam, Question 4\]*

:::: subq
**(a)**   Introducing any notation you use, state the Metropolis--Hastings algorithm for discrete state space, and explain the purpose of this algorithm.

::: myanswers
*Solution.* The Metropolis--Hastings algorithm is a method to sample from a distribution $\pi$ on a discrete space $\mathcal S$ by setting up a Markov chain $(X_i)$ on $\mathcal S$ with stationary distribution $\pi$.

Suppose the Markov chain is at $X_i = x$. The Metropolis--Hastings algorithm proposes a move to $y$ with probability $r(x, y)$, where $\mathsf R = (r(x, y))$ is the transition matrix for an irreducible Markov chain on $\mathcal S$. This move is accepted with probability $$ \alpha(x, y) = \min \left\{ \frac{\pi(y)\,r(y,x)}{\pi(x)\,r(x,y)},\, 1\right\} , $$ meaning that $X_{i+1} = y$, or rejected otherwise, meaning that $X_{i+1} = X_i = x$.

After being run for a large number of steps (possibly with a burn-in period), the values $X_i$ should be approximately distributed like $\pi$.
:::
::::

:::: subq
**(b)**   Using the Metropolis--Hastings algorithm, find a Markov chain with state space $\mathbb N = \{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$ that has stationary distribution $\mathbb P(X_n = x) = 2^{-x}$ for $x \in \mathbb N$.

::: myanswers
*Solution.* Although this isn't the only way, I will use $\mathsf R$ to be the transition matrix of the simple symmetric random walk on $\mathbf Z$. Because this is symmetric, the acceptance probabilities are $$ \begin{align}
\alpha(x, x+1) &= \min \left\{ \frac{\pi(x+1)}{\pi(x)},\, 1 \right\} = \min\big\{\tfrac12,\, 1\big\} = \tfrac 12 \\
\alpha(x, x-1) &= \min \left\{ \frac{\pi(x-1)}{\pi(x)},\, 1 \right\} = \min\{2,\, 1\} = 1,
\end{align} $$ except that $\alpha(1, 0) = 1$.

I'll choose the starting point $X = 1$. From here, the Markov chain repeatedly proposes a move up 1 with probability $\tfrac12$, which is accepted with probability $\tfrac12$, or a move down 1 with probability $\tfrac12$, which is always accepted -- except for a move from 1 down to 0 which is always rejected.

**(c)**   In a Bayesian setting, assume we have observations $Z_1, X_2, \dots, Z_n$ from an $\operatorname{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ distribution, where the prior distribution for $\sigma^2$ is $\operatorname{Exp}(1)$. Using the Metropolis--Hastings algorithm, describe in detail a method for sampling from the posterior distribution of $\sigma^2$.

::: myanswers
*Solution* The posterior distribution is given by $$ \begin{align}
\pi(\sigma^2 \mid \mathbf Z) &\propto \pi(\sigma^2) \prod_{i=1}^n f(z_i \mid \sigma^2) \\
  &= \mathrm{e}^{-\sigma^2} \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sigma^2}} \,\exp\left(- \frac{Z_i^2}{2\sigma^2} \right) \\
  &=  \mathrm{e}^{-\sigma^2} \,\sigma^{-n/2} \,\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \sum_{i=1}^n Z_i^2 \right) .
\end{align} $$

I will choose as the Markov chain a symmetric Gaussian random walk on $\mathbb R$, meaning that the Markov chain is $X_{i+1} = X_i + \mathrm{N}(0, s^2)$. (The special case is known as the random walk Metropolis algorithm in continuous space.) Because this is symmetric, the acceptance probability is $$ \alpha(x, y) = \min \left\{ \frac{ \pi(x \mid \mathbf Z)}{\pi(y \mid \mathbf Z)},\,1\right\} , $$ for $y \geq 0$, where the constant of proportionality in the $\pi$s cancel out, of $\alpha(x, y) = 0$ for $y < 0$.

I would suggest starting from $X_1$ between $1$ (the prior variance) and the sample variance of the $Z_i$ (the posterior variance in the large sample limit $n \to \infty$). I would suggest choosing the step size $s$ by experiment, with smaller $s$ for large $n$, and vice versa.

**(d)**   Let the set $A \subset \mathbb R^2$ be given by $$
A = \big([0,3]\times[0,1]\big) \cup \big([0,1]\times [4,5]\big) 
\cup \big([4,5]\times[0,1]\big) \cup \big([4,5] \times [3,5]\big) .
$$ Consider the Metropolis--Hastings algorithm on $\mathbb R^2$ with target density $$ \pi(\mathbf x) = \begin{cases} \frac17 & \text{if }\mathbf x \in A \\
0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$ for all $x \in \mathbb R^2$, and where the proposals $\mathbf Y_{i+1}$ are chosen uniformly distributed on a disk of radius $r$ around the previous state -- that is, $$ Y_{j+1} \sim \operatorname{U} \Big(\big\{ \mathbf y \in \mathbb R^2 : |\mathbf y - \mathbf X_i | \leq r \big\}\Big) . $$ Assume the algorithm starts at $\mathbf X_1 = (0.5, 0.5)$.

**i.**      For every $r > 0$, determine the stationary distribution of the resulting Markov chain.

**ii.**    For what values of $r$ does the algorithm work correctly?

::: myanswers
*Solution.* To see what's going on where, we need to draw a picture of the set $A$.

The question is: for what $r$ will it be possible to jump between the different blocks. We start from $(0.5, 0.5)$ which is in the bottom-left block. To jump from bottom-left to bottom-right, we need $r > 1$. To jump from bottom-right to top-right, we need $r > 2$. To jump from bottom-left to top-left, we need $r > 3$.

**(i)** The distribution is uniform, so as long as the Markov chain can *reach* an area, the stationary distribution will be uniform there. So the stationary distribution is uniform on the following sets:

-   $0 < r \leq 1$: $\big([0,3]\times[0,1]\big)$

-   $1 < r \leq 2$: $\big([0,3]\times[0,1]\big) \cup \big([4,5]\times[0,1]\big)$

-   $2 < r \leq 3$: $\big([0,3]\times[0,1]\big) \cup \big([4,5]\times[0,1]\big) \cup \big([4,5] \times [3,5]\big)$

-   $r > 3$: $A$

(If $r$ is only *just* above the boundary, convergence to the stationary distribution may be extremely slow.)

**(ii)** The stationary distribution is the desired distribution for $r > 3$, which is the values for which the algorithm technically "works", as $n \to \infty$. To work "well", $r$ will need to be comfortably bigger than 3 (so that movement to and from the top-left is reasonably common) while not being so huge that most steps are to ridiculously far away.

**(c)**   For fixed $x$ and $y$ with $x \leq y$, find $\operatorname{Cov}\big(F^*(y), F^*(x)\big)$.

::: {.myanswers}
*Solution.* Using the same notation again,
$$ \begin{align}
\operatorname{Cov}\big(F(x), F(y)\big)
&= \operatorname{Cov} \left( \frac1n\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{I}_{(-\infty, x]}(X_i) ,  \frac1n\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbb{I}_{(-\infty, y]}(X_i) \right) \\
&= \frac{1}{n^2} \left( \sum_{i=1}^n \operatorname{Cov} \big( \mathbb{I}_{(-\infty, x]}(X_i), \mathbb{I}_{(-\infty, y]}(X_i)\big) + 2 \sum_{i<j} \operatorname{Cov} \big( \mathbb{I}_{(-\infty, x]}(X_i), \mathbb{I}_{(-\infty, y]}(X_j)\big) \right) \\
&= \frac{1}{n^2} \left(n \operatorname{Cov} \big( \mathbb{I}_{(-\infty, x]}(X_i), \mathbb{I}_{(-\infty, y]}(X_i)\big) + 0\right) \\
&= \frac{1}{n} \operatorname{Cov} \big( \mathbb{I}_{(-\infty, x]}(X_i), \mathbb{I}_{(-\infty, y]}(X_i)\big)
\end{align} .$$

So we need to find that covariance. In particular, we need
$$\operatorname{\mathbb E} \big( \mathbb{I}_{(-\infty, x]}(X_i) \mathbb{I}_{(-\infty, y]}(X_i)\big) = F(x),$$
since the produce of indicator function is 1 if and only if both indicators are 1, which is if $X_i \leq x$ and $X_i \leq y$. Since $x$ is the smaller, this is $F(x)$.

Hence we have
$$ \operatorname{Cov}\big(F^*(y), F^*(x)\big) = \frac{1}{n} \big(F(x) - F(x)F(y)\big) = \frac{1}{n}\,F(x) \big(1 - F(y)\big) . $$

**5.**     A random variable $X$ has bounded support, and a statistician wishes to estimate $\theta = \max X$, the maximum value $X$ can take. The statistician has access to 24 IID samples $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_{24}$ from this random variable which can be read into R as follows:

```{r}
   samples <- c(12.40,  2.99, 14.79,  3.59, 24.92,  4.11,
             22.68, 28.30,  0.90,  8.84, 24.17, 31.31,
