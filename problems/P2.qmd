This is Problem Sheet 2, which covers material from Lectures 7 to 11. You should work through all the questions on this problem sheet in advance of the problems class, which takes place in the lecture of **Thursday 30 October**.

This problem sheet is to help you practice material from the module and to help you check your learning. It is *not* for formal assessment and does not count towards your module mark.

If you want some brief informal feedback on **Question 1** (marked â˜…), you should submit your work electronically through Gradescope via the module's Minerva page by **1400 on Tuesday 28 October**. (If you hand-write solutions on paper, the easiest way to scan-and-submit that work is using the Gradescope app on your phone.) I will return some brief comments on your those two questions by the problems class on Thursday 30 October. Because this informal feedback, and not part of the official assessment, I cannot accept late work for any reason -- but I am always happy to discuss any of your work on any question in my office hours.

Full solutions will be released on Friday 31 October.
