We continue @exm-IS1, where we are estimating $\mathbb P(X > 4)$ for $X \sim \operatorname{N}(0,1)$.

For the standard Monte Carlo method, we estimate the root-mean-square error as

```{r}
n <- 1e5
MC_MSE <- var(rnorm(n) > 4) / n
sqrt(MC_MSE)
```

As before, this still varies a lot, but it seems to usually be about $2 \times 10^{-5}$.

For the importance sampling method, we estimate the mean-square error as

```{r}
n <- 1e5
pdf_x <- function(x) dnorm(x, 0, 1)
pdf_y <- function(y) dnorm(y, 4, 1)
samples_y <- rnorm(n, 4, 1)
IS_MSE <- var((pdf_x(samples_y) / pdf_y(samples_y)) * (samples_y > 4)) / n
sqrt(IS_MSE)
```

This is about $2 \times 10^{-7}$. This is about 100 times smaller than for the standard method: equivalent to taking about 10,000 times as many samples! That's a huge improvement, which demonstrates the power of importance sampling.
