In @exm-MCprob, we were estimating $\mathbb P(Z > 2)$, where $Z$ is a standard normal.

Our code was

```{r}
n <- 1e6
samples <- rnorm(n)
MCest <- mean(samples > 2)
MCest
```

So our root-mean-square error can be approximated as

```{r}
MSEest <- var(samples > 2) / n
sqrt(MSEest)
```

since `samples > 2` is the indicator function of whether $X_i > 2$ or not.
