We return to @exm-control, where we were estimating $\Ex \cos(X)$ for $X \sim \operatorname{N}(0,1)$.

The naive Monte Carlo estimate had mean-square and root-mean-square error

```{r}
n <- 1e6
phi <- function(x) cos(x)
samples <- rnorm(n)
MC_MSE <- var(phi(samples)) / n
c(MC_MSE, sqrt(MC_MSE))
```

The variance and root-mean-square error of our control variate estimate, on the other hand, are

```{r}
psi <- function(x) 1 - x^2 / 2
CV_MSE <- var(phi(samples) - psi(samples)) / n
c(CV_MSE, sqrt(CV_MSE))
```

This was a success! The mean-square error roughly halved, from $`r signif(MC_MSE, 2)`$ to $`r signif(CV_MSE, 2)`$. This meant the root-mean-square went down by about a third, from $`r signif(sqrt(MC_MSE), 2)`$ to $`r signif(sqrt(CV_MSE), 2)`$. This is the same amount of error reduction as we would get from doubling $n$, which we got "for free" by using the control variate.
