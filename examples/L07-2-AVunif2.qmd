In @exm-AVunif, we were estimating $\mathbb E \sin U$, where $U$ is continuous uniform on $[0,1]$.

The basic Monte Carlo estimate and its root-mean square error is

```{r}
n <- 1e6
samples <- runif(n)
MCest <- mean(sin(samples))
MC_RMSE <- sqrt(var(sin(samples)) / n)
c(MCest, MC_RMSE)
```

We then used $U' = 1 - U$ as an antithetic variable

```{r}
n <- 1e6
samples1 <- runif(n / 2)
samples2 <- 1 - samples1
AVest <- (1 / n) * sum(sin(samples1) + sin(samples2))
AV_RMSE <- sqrt(var(sin(samples1) + sin(samples2)) / (2 * n))
c(AVest, AV_RMSE)
```

This time, we see a big improvement: the root-mean-square error has gone down by a whole order of magnitude, from $`{r} signif(MC_RMSE, 1)`$ to $`{r} signif(AV_RMSE, 1)`$.

The benefit here can be confirmed by looking at the samples correlation.

```{r}
cor(sin(samples1), sin(samples2))
```

That's a very large negative correlation, which shows why the antithetic variables made such a huge improvement.
