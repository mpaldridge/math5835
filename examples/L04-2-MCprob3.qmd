We continue the example of @exm-MCprob and @exm-MCprob2, where we were estimating $\mathbb P(Z > 2)$ for $Z$ a standard normal.

```{r}
n <- 1e6
samples <- rnorm(n)
MCest   <- mean(samples > 2)
RMSEest <- sqrt(var(samples > 2) / n)
```

Our confidence interval is estimates as follows

```{r}
alpha <- 0.05
quant <- qnorm(1 - alpha / 2)
c(MCest - quant * RMSEest, MCest + quant * RMSEest)
```
