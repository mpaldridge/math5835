Let's try another example. Let $X \sim \operatorname{N}(1, 2^2)$ be a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 2. Suppose we want to find out $\Exg(\sin X)$ (for some reason). While it *might* be possible to somehow calculate the integral $$ \Exg(\sin X) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} (\sin x) \, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\times 2^2}} \exp\left(\frac{(x - 1)^2}{2\times 2^2}\right) \, \mathrm{d} x , $$ that looks extremely difficult to me.

Instead, a Monte Carlo estimation of $\Exg(\sin X)$ is very straightforward.

```{r}
n <- 1e6
samples <- rnorm(n, 1, 2)
MCest <- mean(sin(samples))
MCest
```

Our Monte Carlo estimate is `{r} format(round(MCest, 5), nsmall = 5)`.
