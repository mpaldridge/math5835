In @exm-MCprob4, we were estimating $\mathbb P(Z > 2)$ for $Z$ a standard normal.

The basic Monte Carlo estimate and its root-mean-square error are

```{r}
n <- 1e6
samples <- rnorm(n)
MCest   <- mean(samples > 2)
MC_MSE <- var(samples > 2) / n
c(MCest, sqrt(MC_MSE))
```

We then used $Z' = -Z$ as an antithetic variable. its root-mean-square error are

```{r}
n <- 1e6
samples1 <- rnorm(n / 2)
samples2 <- -samples1
AVest <- (1 / n) * sum((samples1 > 2) + (samples2 > 2))
AV_MSE <- var((samples1 > 2) + (samples2 > 2)) / (2 * n)
c(AVest, sqrt(AV_MSE))
```

This looked like it made very little difference -- perhaps a small improvement. This can be confirmed by looking at the sample correlation with R's `cor()` function.

```{r}
cor(samples1 > 2, samples2 > 2)
```

We see there was a very small but negative correlation: the variance, and hence the mean-square error, was reduced by about 2%.
