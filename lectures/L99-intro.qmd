# Introduction to Statistical Computing





## Background: probability





If we want a bound on how likely are random variable is to be close to its expectation (not just a "large $n$ approximation" like the central limit theorem, but a cast-iron finite-$n$ bound) we can use **Chebyshev's inequality**:
$$ \mathbb P\big(|Z - \Ex Z| > \epsilon\big) \leq \frac{1}{\epsilon^2} \operatorname{Var}(Z) .$$
