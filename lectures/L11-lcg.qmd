## Definition and examples

Last lecture we introduced the idea of pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs), which are deterministic functions that produce a sequence of numbers that look for all practical purposes as if they are random.

We introduced the idea of a recurrence, where we have a function $f$ and start with a seed $x_1$. We then produce a sequence through the recurrence $x_{i+1} = f(x_i)$. So $x_2 = f(x_1)$, $x_3 = f(x_2) = f(f(x_1))$, and so on.

We briefly mentioned a class of such PRNGs called **linear congruential generators**, or **LCGs**. These generator integers between $0$ and $m-1$ using the recurrence function
$$ f(x) = (ax + c) \bmod m , $$
so
$$ x_{i+1} = (ax_i + c) \bmod m . $$

Here, "$\mathrm{mod}\ m$" means "modulo $m$"; that is, we are using modular arithmetic, where when we get to $m - 1$ we wrap back to 0 and start again. (Modular arithmetic is sometimes called "clock arithmetic", because hours of the day work modulo 12: for example, 3 hours after 11 o'clock is 2 o'clock, because $11 + 3 = 14 \equiv 2 \bmod m$.)

In the LCG $x_{i+1} = (ax_i + c) \mod m$:

* $m$ is called the **modulus**,

* $a$ is called the **multiplier**,

* $c$ is called the **increment**,

* $x_1$, the starting point, is called the **seed**.

Why is m = 2^n often?

## Period of an LCG

Why repeat? What is period, and why is large period good? Why is $m$ biggest possible.

Hull--Dobell theorem; Hull--Dobell with $m = 2^b$.

**Next time:** *We'll use our pseudorandom uniform $[0,1]$ random numbers to make random numbers with other discrete or uniform distributions.*

**Summary:**

* Linear congruential generators are pseudorandom number generators based on the recurrence $x_{n+1} = (ax_n + c) \mod m$.

* Any LCG will eventually repeat with periodic behaviour.

* Conditions on $m$, $a$ and $c$ for an LCG to have the maximum possible period $m$ are given by the Hull--Dobell theorem.
