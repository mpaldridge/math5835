# Bootstrap III


## Bootstrap summary

A reminder where we have got to with the bootstrap.

The idea of bootstrapping is that the variability of $\theta^*$ around
$\theta$ can be approximated by the variability of the $T^*_k$ around
$\theta^*$.

We saw that we can estimate the **bias** by
$$ \widehat{\operatorname{bias}}(\theta^*) = \overline{T^*} - \theta^* .$$
If the bias appears to be significant, it can be appropriate to
"de-bias" the plug-in estimator by instead using
$$ \theta^* - \widehat{\operatorname{bias}}(\theta^*) = \theta^* - \big(\overline{T^*} - \theta^*\big) = 2\theta^* -\overline{T^*} . $$

We saw that we can estimate the **variance** by
$$ S^2 = \frac{1}{B-1} \sum_{k=1}^B \big(T^*_k - \overline{T^*}\big)^2 , $$
although it can be more appropriate to centre the approximation at the
plug-in estimator, and use
$$ \frac{1}{B-1} \sum_{k=1}^B \big(T^*_k - \theta^*\big)^2  $$
instead.

## Bootstrap confidence intervals

The one thing left is to look at confidence intervals. We saw that we
can create a $(1-\alpha)$-prediction interval
$(T_\mathrm{L}, T_\mathrm{U})$ for a statistic by taking $T_\mathrm{L}$
to be the lower $\alpha/2$-quantile -- let's call it $T^*_\mathrm{L}$ --
of the $T^*_k$'s and taking $T_\mathrm{U}$ to be the upper
$\alpha/2$-quantile $T^*_\mathrm{U}$ of the $T^*_k$'s.

However, it can again be more appropriate to anchor these to the plug-in
estimator. We have \begin{align}
1 - \alpha &= \mathbb P\big(T^*_\mathrm{L} \leq \overline{T^*} \leq T^*_\mathrm{U} \big) \\
&= \mathbb P\big(T^*_\mathrm{L} - \theta^* \leq \overline{T^*}-\theta^* \leq T^*_\mathrm{U} -\theta^*\big) \\
&= \mathbb P\big(\theta^* - T^*_\mathrm{L}   \geq \theta^* - \overline{T^*} \geq  \theta^* - T^*_\mathrm{U}\big) \\
&= \mathbb P\big(\theta^* + \overline{T^*} - T^*_\mathrm{L}   \geq \theta^*  \geq  \theta^* +  \overline{T^*}- T^*_\mathrm{U}\big) \\
&= \mathbb P\big(\theta^* +  \overline{T^*}- T^*_\mathrm{U}  \leq \theta^*  \leq \theta^* + \overline{T^*} - T^*_\mathrm{L} \big) .
\end{align} Replacing $\overline T^*$ by the plug-in estimator
$\theta^*$ therefore suggests we should take the lower limit to be
$\theta^* + \theta^* - T^*_\mathrm{U} = 2\theta^* - T^*_\mathrm{U}$ and
the upper limit to be
$\theta^* + \theta^* - T^*_\mathrm{L} = 2\theta^* - T^*_\mathrm{L}$.

::: {#exm-sleepagain}
We return to the sleep data example of last time. We seek a 95%
confidence interval.

```{r}
sleep <- read.csv("https://bookdown.org/jgscott/DSGI/data/NHANES_sleep.csv")$SleepHrsNight
m <- length(sleep)

estimate <- mean(sleep)

boots <- 1e5
bootests <- rep(0, boots)
for (k in 1:boots) {
  resample <- sample(sleep, m, replace = TRUE)
  bootests[k] <- mean(resample)
}

Tlower <- quantile(bootests, 0.025)
Tupper <- quantile(bootests, 0.975)

c(Tlower, Tupper)
2 * estimate - c(Tupper, Tlower)
```

Again, our data here was very well behaved, so anchoring to the plug-in
estimator, using the second method, did not make much difference. But
this can be important with a biased estimator or heavily skewed data.

Researchers have looked into lots of other ways to build bootstrap
confidence intervals, but we won't go into those here.
