    "text": "Organisation of MATH5835\nThis module is MATH5835M Statistical Computing.\nThis module lasts for 11 weeks from 29 September to 12 December 2025. The exam will take place sometime between 12 and 23 January 2026.\nThe module leader, the lecturer, and the main author of these notes is Dr Matthew Aldridge. (You can call me “Matt”, “Matthew”, or “Dr Aldridge”, pronounced “old-ridge”.) My email address is m.aldridge@leeds.ac.uk, although I much prefer questions in person at office hours (see below) rather than by email.\nThe HTML webpage is the best way to view the course material. There is also a PDF version, although I have been much less careful about the presentation of this material, and it does not include the problem sheets.\n\nLectures\nThe main way you will learn new material for this module is by attending lectures. There are three lectures per week:\n\nMondays at 1400\nThursdays at 1200\nFridays at 1000\n\nall in in Roger Stevens LT 14.\nI recommend taking your own notes during the lecture. I will put brief summary notes from the lectures on this website, but they will not reflect all the details I say out loud and write on the whiteboard. Lectures will go through material quite quickly and the material may be quite difficult, so it’s likely you’ll want to spend time reading through your notes after the lecture. Lectures should be recorded on the lecture capture system; I find it very difficult to read the whiteboard in these videos, but if you unavoidably miss a lecture, for example due to illness, you may find they are better than nothing.\nIn Weeks 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11, the Thursday lecture will operate as a “problems class” – see more on this below.\nAttendance at lectures in compulsory. You should record your attendance using the UniLeeds app and the QR code on the wall in the 15 minutes before the lecture or the 15 minutes after the lecture (but not during the lecture).\n\n\nProblem sheets and problem classes\nMathematics and statistics are “doing” subjects! To help you learn material for the module and to help you prepare for the exam, I will provide 5 unassessed problem sheets. These are for you to work through in your own time to help you learn; they are not formally assessed. You are welcome to discuss work on the problem sheets with colleagues and friends, although my recommendation would be to write-up your “last, best” attempt neatly by yourself.\nThere will be an optional opportunity to submit one or two questions from the problem sheet to me in advance of the problems class for some brief informal feedback on your work. See the problem sheets for details.\nYou should work through each problem sheet in preparation for the problems class in the Thursday lecture of Week 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11. In the problems class, you should be ready to explain your answers to questions you managed to solve, discuss your progress on questions you partially solved, and ask for help on questions you got stuck on.\nYou can also ask for extra help or feedback at office hours (see below).\n\n\nCoursework\nThere will be one piece of assessed coursework, which will make up 20% of your module mark. You can read more about the coursework here.\nThe coursework will be in the form of a worksheet. The worksheet will have some questions, mostly computational but also mathematical, and you will have to write a report containing your answers and computations.\nThe assessed coursework will be introduced in the computer practical sessions in Week 9.\nThe deadline for the coursework will be the penultimate day of the Autumn term, Thursday 12 December  at 1400. Feedback and marks will be returned on Monday 13 January, the first day of the Spring term.\n\n\nOffice hours\nI will run a n optional “office hours” drop-in session each week for feedback and consultation. You can come along if you want to talk to me about anything on the module, including if you’d like more feedback on your attempts at problem sheet questions. (For extremely short queries, you can approach me before or after lectures, but my response will often be: “Come to my office hours, and we can discuss it there!”)\nOffice hours will happen on Thursdays from 1300 to 1400 – so directly after the Thursday lecture / problems class – in my office, which is EC Stoner 9.10n in “Maths Research Deck” area on the 9th floor of the EC Stoner building. (One way to the Maths Research Deck is via the doors directly opposite the main entrance to the School of Mathematics; you can also get there from Staircase 1 on the Level 10 “red route” through EC Stoner, next to the Maths Satellite.) If you cannot make this time, contact me for an alternative arrangement.\n\n\nExam\nThere will be one exam, which will make up 80% of your module mark.\nThe exam will be in the January 2026 exam period (12–23 January); the date and time will be announced in December. The exam will be in person and on campus.\nThe exam will last 2 hours and 30 minutes. The exam will consist of 4 questions, all compulsory. You will be allowed to use a permitted calculator in the exam.",

    "text": "Content of MATH5835\n\nNecessary background\nI recommend that students should have completed at least two undergraduate level courses in probability or statistics – although confidence and proficiency in basic material is more important than very deep knowledge of more complicated topics.\nFor Leeds undergraduates, MATH2715 Statistical Methods is an official prerequisite (please get in touch with me if you are/were a Leeds undergraduate and have not taken MATH2715), although confidence and proficiency in the more basic material of MATH1710 & MATH1712 Probability and Statistics 1 & 2 is probably more important.\nSome knowledge I will assume:\n\nProbability: Basic rules of probability; random variables, both continuous and discrete; “famous” distributions (especially the normal distribution and the continuous uniform distribution); expectation, variance, covariance, correlation; law of large numbers and central limit theorem.\nStatistics: Estimation of parameters; bias and error; sample mean and sample variance\n\nThis module will also include an material on Markov chains. I won’t assume any pre-existing knowledge of this, and I will introduce all new material we need, but students who have studied Markov chains before (for example in the Leeds module MATH2750 Introduction to Markov Processes) may find a couple of lectures here are merely a reminder of things they already know.\nThe lectures will include examples using the R program language. The coursework and problem sheets will require use of R. The exam, while just a “pencil and paper” exam, will require understanding and writing short portions of R code. We will assume basic R capability – that you can enter R commands, store R objects using the &lt;- assignment, and perform basic arithmetic with numbers and vectors. Other concepts will be introduced as necessary. If you want to use R on your own device, I recommend downloading (if you have not already) the R programming language and the program RStudio. (These lecture notes were written in R using RStudio.)\n\n\nSyllabus\nWe plan to cover the following topics in the module:\n\nMonte Carlo estimation: definition and examples; bias and error; variance reduction techniques: control variates, antithetic variables, importance sampling. [9 lectures]\nRandom number generation: pseudo-random number generation using linear congruential generators; inverse transform method; rejection sampling [7 lectures]\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC): [7 lectures]\n\nIntroduction to Markov chains in discrete and continuous space\nMetropolis–Hastings algorithm: definition; examples; MCMC in practice; MCMC for Bayesian statistics\n\nResampling methods: Empirical distribution; plug-in estimation; bootstrap statistics; bootstrap estimation [4 lectures]\nFrequently-asked questions [1 lecture]\n\nTogether with the 5 problems classes, this makes 33 lectures.\n\n\nBook\nThe following book is strongly recommended for the module:\n\nJ Voss, An Introduction to Statistical Computing: A simulation-based approach, Wiley Series in Computational Statistics, Wiley, 2014\n\nThe library has electronic access to this book (and two paper copies).\nDr Voss is a lecturer in the School of Mathematics and the University of Leeds, and has taught MATH5835 many times. An Introduction to Statistical Computing grew out of his lecture notes for this module, so the book is ideally suited for this module. My lectures will follow this book closely – specifically:\n\nMonte Carlo estimation: Sections 3.1–3.3\nRandom number generation: Sections 1.1–1.4\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo: Section 2.3 and Sections 4.1–4.3\nBootstrap: Section 5.2\n\nFor a second look at material, for preparatory reading, for optional extended reading, or for extra exercises, this book comes with my highest recommendation!",

    "text": "1.1 What is statistical computing?\nToday, we’ll start the first main topic of the module, which is called “Monte Carlo estimation”. But first, a bit about the subject as a whole.\n“Statistical computing” – or “computational statistics” – refers to the branch of statistics that involves not attacking statistical problems merely with a pencil and paper, but rather by combining human ingenuity with the immense calculating powers of computers.\nOne of the big ideas here is simulation. Simulation is the idea that we can understand the properties of a random model not by cleverly working out the properties using theory – this is usually impossible for anything but the simplest “toy models” – but rather by running the model many times on a computer. From these many simulations, we can observe and measure things like the typical (or “expected”) behaviour, the spread (or “variance”) of the behaviour, and other things. This concept of simulation is at the heart of the module MATH5835M Statistical Computing.\nIn particular, we will look at Monte Carlo estimation. Monte Carlo is about estimating a parameter, expectation or probability related to a random variable by taking many samples of that random variable, then computing a relevant sample mean from those samples. We will study Monte Carlo in its standard “basic” form, then look at ways we can make Monte Carlo estimation more accurate (Lectures 1–9).\nTo run a simulation – for example, when performing Monte Carlo estimation – one needs random numbers with the correct distribution. Random number generation (Lectures 10–16) will be an important part of this module. We will look first at how to generate randomness of any sort, and then how to manipulate that randomness into the shape of the distributions we want.\nSometimes, it’s not possible to generate perfectly independent samples from exactly the distribution you want. But we can use the output of a process called a “Markov chain” to get “fairly independent” samples from nearly the distribution we want. When we perform Monte Carlo estimation with the output of a Markov chain, this is called Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) (Lectures 17–23). MCMC has become a vital part of modern Bayesian statistical analysis.\nThe final section of the module is about dealing with data. Choosing a random piece of data from a given dataset is a lot like generating a random number from a given distribution, and similar Monte Carlo estimation ideas can be used to find out about that data. We think of a dataset as being a sample from a population, and sampling again from that dataset is known as resampling (Lecture 24–27). The most important method of finding out about a population by using resampling from a dataset is called the “bootstrap”, and we will study the bootstrap in detail.\nMATH5835M Statistical Computing is a mathematics module that will concentrate on the mathematical ideas that underpin statistical computing. It is not a programming module that will go deeply into the practical issues of the most efficient possible coding of the algorithms we study. But we will want to investigate the behaviour of the methods we learn about and to explore their properties, so will be computer programming to help us do that. We will be using the statistical programming language R, (although one could just as easily have used Python or other similar languages). As my PhD supervisor often told me: “You don’t really understand a mathematical algorithm until you’ve coded it up yourself.”",

    "section": "1.2 What is Monte Carlo estimation?",
    "text": "1.2 What is Monte Carlo estimation?\nLet \\(X\\) be a random variable. We recall the expectation \\(\\Ex X\\) of \\(X\\). If \\(X\\) is discrete with probability mass function (PMF) \\(p\\), then the expectation of \\(X\\) is \\[ \\Ex X = \\sum_x x\\,p(x) ;\\] while if \\(X\\) is continuous with probability density function (PDF) \\(f\\), then the expectation is \\[ \\Ex X = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} x\\,f(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x . \\] More generally, the expectation of a function \\(\\phi\\) of \\(X\\) is \\[ \\Exg \\phi(X) = \\begin{cases} {\\displaystyle \\sum_x \\phi(x)\\,p(x)} & \\text{for $X$ discrete}\\\\ {\\displaystyle \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\phi(x)\\,f(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x}  & \\text{for $X$ continuous.} \\end{cases}\\] (This matches with the “plain” expectation when \\(\\phi(x) = x\\).)\nBut how do we actually calculate an expectation like one of these? If \\(X\\) is discrete and can only take a small, finite number of values, then we can simply add up the sum \\(\\sum_x \\phi(x)\\,p(x)\\). But otherwise, we just have to hope that \\(\\phi\\) and \\(p\\) or \\(f\\) are sufficiently “nice” that we can manage to work out the sum/integral using a pencil and paper (and our brain). But while this is often possible in the sort of “toy example” one comes across in maths or statistics lectures, this is very rare in “real life” problems.\nMonte Carlo estimation is the idea that we can get an approximate answer for \\(\\Ex X\\) or \\(\\Exg \\phi(X)\\) if we have access to lots of samples from \\(X\\). If we have access to \\(X_1, X_2 \\dots, X_n\\) , independent and identically distributed (IID) samples with the same distribution as \\(X\\), then we already know that the mean \\[ \\overline X = \\frac{1}{n}(X_1 + X_2 + \\cdots + X_n) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i \\] can be used to estimate the expectation \\(\\mathbb EX\\). We know that \\(\\overline X\\) is usually close to the expectation \\(\\Ex X\\), at least if if the number of samples \\(n\\) is large; this is justified by the “law of large numbers”, which says that \\(\\overline X \\to \\mathbb EX\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\).\nSimilarly, we can use \\[ \\frac{1}{n} \\big(\\phi(X_1) + \\phi(X_2) + \\cdots + \\phi(X_n) \\big) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\phi(X_i) \\] to estimate \\(\\Exg \\phi(X)\\). The law of large numbers again says that this estimate tends to the correct value \\(\\Exg \\phi(X)\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\).\nIn this module we will write that \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n\\) is a “random sample from \\(X\\)” to mean that \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n\\) are IID with the same distribution as \\(X\\).\n\nDefinition 1.1 Let \\(X\\) be a random variable, \\(\\phi\\) a function, and write \\(\\theta = \\Exg\\phi(X)\\). Then the Monte Carlo estimator \\(\\widehat\\theta_n^{\\mathrm{MC}}\\) of \\(\\theta\\) is \\[ \\widehat{\\theta}_n^{\\mathrm{MC}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\phi(X_i) , \\] where \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n\\) are a random sample from \\(X\\).\n\nWhile general ideas for estimating using simulation go back a long time, the modern theory of Monte Carlo estimation was developed by the physicists Stanislaw Ulam and John von Neumann. Ulam (who was Polish) and von Neumann (who was Hungarian) moved to the US in the early 1940s to work on the Manhattan project to build the atomic bomb (as made famous by the film Oppenheimer). Later in the 1940s, they worked together in the Los Alamos National Laboratory continuing their research on nuclear physics generally and nuclear weapons more specifically, where they used simulations on early computers to help them numerically solve difficult mathematical and physical problems.\nThe name “Monte Carlo” was chosen because the use of randomness to solve such problems reminded them of gamblers in the casinos of Monte Carlo, Monaco. Ulam and von Neumann also worked closely with another colleague Nicholas Metropolis, whose work we will study later in this module.",

    "section": "1.3 Examples",
    "text": "1.3 Examples\nLet’s see some simple examples of Monte Carlo estimation using R.\n\nExample 1.1 Let’s suppose we’ve forgotten the expectation of the exponential distribution \\(X \\sim \\operatorname{Exp}(2)\\) with rate 2. In this simple case, we could work out the answer using the PDF \\(f(x) = 2\\mathrm{e}^{-2x}\\) as\n\\[ \\mathbb E X = \\int_0^\\infty x\\,2\\mathrm{e}^{-2x}\\,\\mathrm{d}x \\]and, without too much difficulty, get the answer \\(\\frac12\\). But instead, let’s do this the Monte Carlo way.\nIn R, we can use the rexp() function to get IID samples from the exponential distribution: the full syntax is rexp(n, rate), which gives n samples from an exponential distribution with rate rate. The following code takes the mean of \\(n = 100\\) samples from the exponential distribution.\n\nn &lt;- 100\nsamples &lt;- rexp(n, 2)\nMCest &lt;- (1 / n) * sum(samples)\nMCest\n\n[1] 0.5378136\n\n\nSo our Monte Carlo estimate is 0.5378, to 4 decimal places.\nThat’s fairly close to the correct answer of \\(\\frac12\\). But we should (hopefully) be able to get a more accurate estimation if we use more samples. We could also simplify the third line of our code by using the mean() function.\n\nn &lt;- 1e6\nsamples &lt;- rexp(n, 2)\nMCest &lt;- mean(samples)\nMCest\n\n[1] 0.4994785\n\n\nIn the second line, 1e6 is R code for the scientific notation \\(1 \\times 10^6\\), or a million. I just picked this as “a big number, but where my code still only took a few seconds to run.”\nOur new Monte Carlo estimate is 0.4995, which is (probably) much closer to the true value of \\(\\frac12\\).\n\nBy the way: all R code “chunks” displayed in the notes should work perfectly if you copy-and-paste them into RStudio. (Indeed, when I compile these lecture notes in RStudio, all the R code gets run on my computer – so I’m certain in must work correctly!) If you hover over a code chunk, a little “clipboard” icon should appear in the top-right, and clicking on that will copy it so you can paste it into RStudio. I strongly encourage playing about with the code as a good way to learn this material and explore further!\n\nExample 1.2 Let’s try another example. Let \\(X \\sim \\operatorname{N}(1, 2^2)\\) be a normal distribution with mean 1 and standard deviation 2. Suppose we want to find out \\(\\mathbb E(\\sin X)\\) (for some reason). While it might be possible to somehow calculate the integral \\[ \\mathbb E(\\sin X) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} (\\sin x) \\, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\times 2^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x - 1)^2}{2\\times 2^2}\\right) \\, \\mathrm{d} x , \\] that looks extremely difficult to me.\nInstead, a Monte Carlo estimation of \\(\\mathbb{E}(\\sin X)\\) is very straightforward: we just take the mean of the sine of a bunch of normally distributed random numbers. That is we get a random samples \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n\\) from \\(X\\); then take the mean of the values \\[\\sin(X_1), \\sin(X_2), \\dots, \\sin(X_n) .\\]\n(We must remember, though, when using the rnorm() function to generate normally distributed random variates, that the third argument is the standard deviation, here \\(2\\), not the variance, here \\(2^2 = 4\\).)\n\nn &lt;- 1e6\nsamples &lt;- rnorm(n, 1, 2)\nMCest &lt;- mean(sin(samples))\nMCest\n\n[1] 0.1129711\n\n\nOur Monte Carlo estimate is 0.11297.\n\nNext time: We look at more examples of things we can estimate using the Monte Carlo method.\n\nSummary:\n\nStatistical computing is about solving statistical problems by combining human ingenuity with computing power.\nThe Monte Carlo estimate of \\(\\Exg \\phi(X)\\) is \\[ \\widehat{\\theta}_n^{\\mathrm{MC}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\phi(X_i) , \\] where \\(X_1, \\dots, X_n\\) are IID random samples from \\(X\\).\nMonte Carlo estimation typically gets more accurate as the number of samples \\(n\\) gets bigger.\n\nRead more: Voss, An Introduction to Statistical Computing, Section 3.1 and Subsection 3.2.1.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "2.1 Monte Carlo for probabilities\nQuick recap: Last time we defined the Monte Carlo estimator for an expectation of a function of a random variable \\(\\theta = \\Exg \\phi(X)\\) to be \\[ \\widehat{\\theta}_n^{\\mathrm{MC}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\big(\\phi(X_1) + \\phi(X_2) + \\cdots + \\phi(X_n) \\big) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\phi(X_i) , \\] where \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n\\) are independent random samples from \\(X\\).\nToday we look at two other things we can estimate using Monte Carlo simulation: probabilities, and integrals.\nWhat if we want to find a probability, rather than an expectation? What if we want \\(\\mathbb P(X = x)\\) for some \\(x\\), or \\(\\mathbb P(X \\geq a)\\) for some \\(a\\), or, more generally, \\(\\mathbb P(X \\in A)\\) for some set \\(A\\)?\nThe key thing that will help us here is the indicator function. The indicator function simply tells us whether an outcome \\(x\\) is in a set \\(A\\) or not.\nThe set \\(A\\) could just be a single element \\(A = \\{y\\}\\). In that case \\(\\Ind_A(x)\\) is 1 if \\(x = y\\) and 0 if \\(x \\neq y\\). Or \\(A\\) could be a semi-infinite interval, like \\(A = [a, \\infty)\\). In that case \\(\\Ind_A(x)\\) is 1 if \\(x \\geq a\\) and 0 if \\(x &lt; a\\).\nWhy is this helpful? Well \\(\\Ind_A\\) is a function, so let’s think about what the expectation \\(\\Exg \\Ind_A(X)\\) would be for some random variable \\(X\\). Since \\(\\Ind_A\\) can only take two values, 0 and 1, we have \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\Exg \\Ind_A(X) &= \\sum_{y \\in\\{0,1\\}} y\\,\\mathbb P\\big( \\Ind_A(X) = y \\big) \\\\\\\n  &= 0 \\times \\mathbb P\\big( \\Ind_A(X) = 0 \\big) + 1 \\times \\mathbb P\\big( \\Ind_A(X) = 1 \\big) \\\\\n  &= 0 \\times \\mathbb P(X \\notin A) + 1 \\times \\mathbb P(X \\in A) \\\\\n  &= \\mathbb P(X \\in A) .\n\\end{align*}\\] P(X A) . \\end{align*} In line three, we used that \\(\\Ind_A(X) = 0\\) if and only if \\(X \\notin A\\), and that \\(\\Ind_A(X) = 1\\) if and only if \\(X \\in A\\).\nSo the expectation of an indicator function a set is the probability that \\(X\\) is in that set. This idea connects “expectations of functions” back to probabilities: if we want to find \\(\\mathbb P(X \\in A)\\) we can find the expectation of \\(\\Ind_A(X)\\).\nWith this idea in hand, how do we estimate \\(\\theta = \\mathbb P(X \\in A)\\) using the Monte Carlo method? We write \\(\\theta = \\Exg\\Ind_A(X)\\). Then our Monte Carlo estimator is \\[  \\widehat{\\theta}_n^{\\mathrm{MC}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\Ind_A(X_i) . \\]\nWe remember that \\(\\Ind_A(X_i)\\) is 1 if \\(X_i \\in A\\) and 0 otherwise. So if we add up \\(n\\) of these, we count an extra +1 each time we have an \\(X_i \\in A\\). So \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\Ind_A(X_i)\\) counts the total number of the \\(X_i\\) that are in \\(A\\). So the Monte Carlo estimator can be written as \\[  \\widehat{\\theta}_n^{\\mathrm{MC}} = \\frac{\\# \\text{ of } X_i \\text{ that are in $A$}}{n} . \\] (I’m using \\(\\#\\) as shorthand for “the number of”.)\nAlthough we’ve had to do a bit of work to get here, this a totally logical outcome! The right-hand side here is the proportion of the samples for which \\(X_i \\in A\\). And if we want to estimate the probability something happens, looking at the proportion of times it happens in a random sample is very much the “intuitive” estimate to take. And that intuitive estimate is indeed the Monte Carlo estimate!\nWe should explain the third line in the code we used for the Monte Carlo estimation mean(samples &gt; 2). In R, some statements can be answered “true” or “false”: these are often statements involving equality == (that’s a double equals sign) or inequalities like &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, &gt;, for example. So 5 &gt; 2 is TRUE but 3 == 7 is FALSE. These can be applied “component by component” to vectors. So, for example, testing which numbers from 1 to 10 are greater than or equal to 7, we get\n1:10 &gt;= 7\n\n [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\nsix FALSEs (for 1 to 6) followed by four TRUEs (for 7 to 10).\nWe can also use & (“and”) and | (“or”) in true/false statements like these.\nBut R also knows to treat TRUE like the number 1 and FALSE like the number 0. (This is just like the concept of the indicator function we’ve been discussing.) So if we add up some TRUEs and FALSEs, R simply counts how many TRUEs there are\nsum(1:10 &gt;= 7)\n\n[1] 4\nSo in our Monte Carlo estimation code, samples &gt; 2 was a vector of TRUEs and FALSEs, depending on whether each sample was greater than 2 or not, then mean(samples &gt; 2) took the proportion of the samples that were greater than 2.",

    "text": "2.2 Monte Carlo for integrals\nThere’s another thing – a non-statistics thing – that Monte Carlo estimation is useful for. We can use Monte Carlo estimation to approximate integrals that are too hard to do by hand.\nThis might seem surprising. Estimating the expectation of (a function of) a random variable seems a naturally statistical thing to do. But an integral is just a straight maths problem – there’s not any randomness at all. But actually, integrals and expectations are very similar things.\nLet’s think of an integral: say, \\[ \\int_a^b h(x) \\,\\mathrm{d}x ,\\] the integral of some function \\(h\\) (the “integrand”) between the limits \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Now let’s compare that to the integral \\(\\Exg \\phi(X)\\) of a continuous random variable that we can estimate using Monte Carlo estimation, \\[ \\Exg \\phi(X) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\phi(x)\\,f(x)\\, \\mathrm{d} x. \\] Matching things up, we can see that we if we were to a function \\(\\phi\\) and a PDF \\(f\\) such that \\[ \\phi(x)\\,f(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 & x &lt; a \\\\ h(x) & a \\leq x \\leq b \\\\ 0 & x &gt; b , \\end{cases}  \\tag{2.1}\\] then we would have \\[ \\Exg \\phi(X) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\phi(x)\\,f(x)\\, \\mathrm{d} x = \\int_a^b h(x) \\,\\mathrm{d}x, \\] so the value of the expectation would be precisely the value of the integral we’re after. Then we could use Monte Carlo to estimate that expectation/integral.\nThere are lots of choices of \\(\\phi\\) and \\(f\\) that would satisfy this the condition in Equation 2.1. But a “common-sense” choice that often works is to pick \\(f\\) to be the PDF of \\(X\\), a continuous uniform distribution on the interval \\([a,b]\\). (This certainly works when \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are finite, anyway.) Recall that the continuous uniform distribution means that \\(X\\) has PDF \\[ f(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 & x &lt; a \\\\ \\displaystyle{\\frac{1}{b-a}} & a \\leq x \\leq b \\\\ 0 & x &gt; b . \\end{cases} \\] Comparing this equation with Equation 2.1, we then have to choose \\[\\phi(x) = \\frac{h(x)}{f(x)} = (b-a)h(x).\\]\nPutting this all together, we have \\[ \\Exg \\phi(X) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\phi(x)\\,f(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_a^b (b-a)h(x)\\,\\frac{1}{b-a}\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_a^b h(x) \\,\\mathrm{d}x ,\\] as required. This can then be estimated using the Monte Carlo method.\n\nDefinition 2.2 Consider an integral \\(\\theta = \\int_a^b h(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x\\). Let \\(f\\) be the probability density function of a random variable \\(X\\) and let \\(\\phi\\) be function such that Equation 2.1 holds. Then the Monte Carlo estimator \\(\\widehat\\theta_n^{\\mathrm{MC}}\\) of the integral \\(\\theta\\) is \\[ \\widehat{\\theta}_n^{\\mathrm{MC}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\phi(X_i) , \\] where \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n\\) are a random sample from \\(X\\).\n\n\nExample 2.2 Suppose we want to approximate the integral \\[ \\int_0^2 x^{1.6} (2-x)^{0.7} \\, \\mathrm{d}x . \\]\nSince this is an integral on the finite interval \\([0,2]\\), it would seem to make sense to pick \\(X\\) to be uniform on \\([0,2]\\). This means we should take \\[\\phi(x) = \\frac{h(x)}{f(x)} = (2-0)h(x) = 2\\,x^{1.6}(2-x)^{0.7}.\\] We can then approximate this integral in R using the Monte Carlo estimator \\[ \\int_0^2 x^{1.6} (2-x)^{0.7} \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\operatorname{\\mathbb{E}} \\phi(X) \\approx \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n 2\\,X_i^{1.6} (2-X_i)^{0.7} . \\]\n\nn &lt;- 1e6\nintegrand &lt;- function(x) x^1.6 * (2 - x)^0.7\na &lt;- 0\nb &lt;- 2\nsamples &lt;- runif(n, a, b)\nmean((b - a) * integrand(samples))\n\n[1] 1.443793\n\n\nYou have perhaps noticed that, here and elsewhere, I tend to split my R code up into lots of small bits, perhaps slightly unnecessarily. After all, those 6 lines of code could simply have been written as just 2 lines\n\nsamples &lt;- runif(1e6, 0, 2)\nmean(2 * samples^1.6 * (2 - samples)^0.7)\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with that. However, I find that code is easier to read if divided into small pieces. It also makes it easier to tinker with, if I want to use it to solve some similar but slightly different problem.\n\n\nExample 2.3 Suppose we want to approximate the integral \\[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}\n\\mathrm{e}^{-0.1|x|} \\cos x \\, \\mathrm{d}x . \\] This one is an integral on the whole real line, so we can’t take a uniform distribution. Maybe we should take \\(f(x)\\) to be the PDF of a normal distribution, and then put \\[ \\phi(x) = \\frac{h(x)}{f(x)} = \\frac{\\mathrm{e}^{-0.1|x|} \\cos x}{f(x)} . \\]\nBut which normal distribution should we take? Well, we’re allowed to take any one – we will still get an accurate estimate in the limit as \\(n \\to \\infty\\). But we’d like an estimator that gives accurate results at moderate-sized \\(n\\), and picking a “good” distribution for \\(X\\) will help that.\nWe’ll probably get the best results if we pick a distribution that is likely to mostly take values where \\(h(x)\\) is big – or, rather, where the absolute value \\(|h(x)|\\) is big, to be precise. That is because we don’t want to “waste” too many samples where \\(h(x)\\) is very small, because they don’t contribute much to the integral. But we don’t want to “miss” – or only sample very rarely – places where \\(h(x)\\) is big, which contribute a lot to the integral.\nLet’s have a look at the graph of \\(h(x) = \\mathrm{e}^{-0.1|x|} \\cos x\\).\n\n\nCode for drawing this graph\nintegrand &lt;- function(x) exp(-0.1 * abs(x)) * cos(x)\n\ncurve(\n  integrand, n = 1001, from = -55, to = 55,\n  col = \"blue\", lwd = 3,\n  xlab = \"x\", ylab = \"integrand h(x)\", xlim = c(-50,50)\n)\nabline(h = 0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis suggests to me that a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 20 might work quite well, since this will tend to take values in \\([-40,40]\\) or so.\nWe will use R’s function dnorm() for the probability density function of the normal distribution (which saves us from having to remember what that is).\n\nn &lt;- 1e6\nintegrand &lt;- function(x) exp(-0.1 * abs(x)) * cos(x)\npdf       &lt;- function(x) dnorm(x, 0, 20)\nphi       &lt;- function(x) integrand(x) / pdf(x)\n\nsamples &lt;- rnorm(n, 0, 20)\nmean(phi(samples))\n\n[1] 0.235336\n\n\n\nNext time: We will analyse the accuracy of these Monte Carlo estimates.\n\nSummary:\n\nThe indicator \\(\\Ind_A(x)\\) function of a set \\(A\\) is 1 if \\(x \\in A\\) or 0 if \\(x \\notin A\\).\nWe can estimate a probability \\(\\mathbb P(X \\in A)\\) by using the Monte Carlo estimate for \\(\\Exg\\Ind_A(X)\\).\nWe can estimate an integral \\(\\int h(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x\\) by using a Monte Carlo estimate with \\(\\phi(x)\\,f(x) = h(x)\\).\n\nRead more: Voss, An Introduction to Statistical Computing, Section 3.1 and Subsection 3.2.1.",

    "text": "3.1 Estimation error\nToday we are going to analysing the accuracy of Monte Carlo estimation. But before talking about Monte Carlo estimation specifically, let’s first remind ourselves of some concepts about error in statistical estimation more generally. We will use the following definitions.\nUsually, the main goal of estimation is to get the mean-square error of an estimate as small as possible. This is because the MSE measures by what distance we are missing on average. It can be easier to interpret what the root-mean-square error means, as the RMSE has the same units as the parameter being measured: if \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) are in metres, say, then the MSE is in metres-squared, whereas the RMSE error is in metres again. If you minimise the MSE you also minimise the RMSE and vice versa.\nIt’s nice to have an “unbiased” estimator – that is, one with bias 0. This is because bias measures any systematic error in a particular direction. However, unbiasedness by itself is not enough for an estimate to be good – we need low variance too. (Remember the old joke about the statistician who misses his first shot ten yards to the left, misses his second shot ten yards to the right, then claims to have “hit the target on average.”)\n(Remember also that “bias” is simply the word statisticians use for \\(\\mathbb E(\\widehat\\theta - \\theta)\\); we don’t mean “bias” in the derogatory way it is sometimes used in political arguments, for example.)\nYou probably also remember the relationship between the mean-square error, the bias, and the variance:\nSince the bias contributes to the mean-square error, that’s another reason to like estimator with low – or preferably zero – bias. But again, unbiasedness isn’t enough by itself; we want low variance too. (There are some situations where there’s a “bias–variance tradeoff”, where allowing some bias reduces the variance and so can reduce the MSE. It turns out that Monte Carlo is not one of these cases, however.)",

    "text": "3.3 Error of Monte Carlo estimator: practice\nSo when we form a Monte Carlo estimate \\(\\hat\\theta_n^{\\text{MC}}\\), we now know it will be unbiased. We’d also like to know it’s mean-square and/or root-mean-square error too.\nThere’s a problem here, though. The reason we are doing Monte Carlo estimation in the first place is that we couldn’t calculate \\(\\Exg \\phi(X)\\). So it seems very unlikely we’ll be able to calculate the variance \\(\\operatorname{Var}(\\phi(X))\\) either. So how will be able to assess the mean-square (or root-mean-square) error of our Monte Carlo estimator?\nWell, we can’t know it exactly. But we can estimate the variance from the samples we are already using: by taking the sample variance of the samples \\(\\phi(x_i)\\). That is, we can estimate the variance of the Monte Carlo estimator by the sample variance \\[ S^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\big(\\phi(X_i) - \\widehat{\\theta}_n^{\\mathrm{MC}} \\big)^2 . \\] Then we can similarly estimate the mean-square and root-mean-square errors by \\[ \\text{MSE} \\approx \\frac{1}{n}S^2 \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad \\text{RMSE} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} S^2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\,S  \\] respectively.\n\nExample 3.1 Let’s go back to the very first example in the module, Example 1.1, where we were trying to find the expectation of an \\(\\operatorname{Exp}(2)\\) random variable.

We will use the sample variance function var() to calculate the sample variance. In this simple case, the function is \\(\\phi(x) = x\\), so we need only use the variance of the samples themselves.\n\nvar_est &lt;- var(samples)\nMSEest  &lt;- var_est / n\nRMSEest &lt;- sqrt(MSEest)\nc(var_est, MSEest, RMSEest)\n\n[1] 2.497426e-01 2.497426e-07 4.997425e-04\n\n\nThe first number is var_est \\(= 0.2497\\), the sample variance of our \\(\\phi(x_i)\\)s:\n\\[ s^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\big(\\phi(x_i) - \\widehat{\\theta}_n^{\\mathrm{MC}}\\big)^2 . \\] This should be a good estimate of the true variance \\(\\operatorname{Var}(\\phi(X))\\). (In fact, in this simple case, we know that \\(\\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\frac{1}{2^2} = 0.25\\), so we know that the estimate is good.) In calculating this in the code, we used R’s var() function, which calculates the sample variance of some values.\nThe second number is MSEest \\(= 2.497\\times 10^{-7}\\), our estimate of the mean-square error. Since \\(\\operatorname{MSE}(\\widehat{\\theta}_n^{\\mathrm{MC}}) = \\frac{1}{n} \\operatorname{Var}(\\phi(X))\\), then \\(\\frac{1}{n} S^2\\) should be a good estimate of the MSE.\nThe third number is RMSEest \\(= 5\\times 10^{-4}\\) our estimate of the root-mean square error, which is simply the square-root of our estimate of the mean-square error.\n\n\nExample 3.2 In Example 2.1, we were estimating \\(\\mathbb P(Z &gt; 2)\\), where \\(Z\\) is a standard normal.\nOur code was\n\nn &lt;- 1e6\nsamples &lt;- rnorm(n)\nMCest &lt;- mean(samples &gt; 2)\nMCest\n\n[1] 0.022299\n\n\nSo our root-mean-square error can be approximated as\n\nMSEest &lt;- var(samples &gt; 2) / n\nsqrt(MSEest)\n\n[1] 0.0001476542\n\n\nsince samples &gt; 2 is the indicator function of whether \\(X_i &gt; 2\\) or not.\n\nNext time: We’ll continue analysing Monte Carlo error, looking at confidence intervals and assessing how many samples to take..\n\nSummary:\n\nThe Monte Carlo estimator is unbiased.\nThe Monte Carlo estimator has mean-square error \\(\\Var(\\phi(X))/n\\), so the root-mean-square error scales like \\(1/\\sqrt{n}\\).\nThe mean-square error can be estimated by \\(S^2 / n\\), where \\(S^2\\) is the sample variance of the \\(\\phi(X_i)\\).\n\nRead more: Voss, An Introduction to Statistical Computing, Subsection 3.2.2.",

    "text": "4.2 Confidence intervals\nSo far, we have described our error tolerance in terms of the MSE or RMSE. But we could have talked about “confidence intervals” or “margins of error” instead. This might be easier to understand for non-mathematicians, for whom “root-mean-square error” doesn’t really mean anything.\nHere, we will want to appeal to the central limit theorem approximation. A bit more probability revision: Let \\(Y_1, Y_2, \\dots\\) be IID again, with expectation \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). Write \\(\\overline Y_n\\) for the mean. We’ve already reminded ourselves of the law of large numbers, which says that \\(\\overline Y_n \\to \\mu\\) as \\(n \\to infty\\). Then in the last lecture we saw that \\(\\mathbb E \\overline Y_n = \\mu\\) and \\(\\Var(\\overline{Y}_n) = \\sigma^2/n\\). The central limit theorem says that the distribution of \\(\\overline Y_n\\) is approximately normally distributed with those parameters, so \\(\\overline Y_n \\approx \\operatorname{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2/n)\\) when \\(n\\) is large. (This is an informal statement of the central limit theorem: you probably know some more formal ways to more precisely state it, but this will do for us.)\nRecall that, in the normal distribution \\(\\operatorname{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\), we expect to be within \\(1.96\\) standard deviations of the mean with 95% probability. More generally, the interval \\([\\mu - q_{1-\\alpha/2}\\sigma, \\mu + q_{1-\\alpha/2}\\sigma]\\), where \\(q_{1-\\alpha/2}\\) is the \\((1- \\frac{\\alpha}{2})\\)-quantile of the normal distribution, contains the true value with probability approximately \\(1 - \\alpha\\).\nWe can form an approximate confidence interval for a Monte Carlo estimate using this idea. We have our Monte Carlo estimator \\(\\widehat{\\theta}_n^\\mathrm{MC}\\) as our estimator of the \\(\\mu\\) parameter, and our estimator of the root-mean-square error \\(S/\\sqrt{n}\\) as our estimator of the \\(\\sigma\\) parameter. So our confidence interval is estimated as \\[\\bigg[ \\widehat{\\theta}_n^\\mathrm{MC} - q_{1-\\alpha/2}\\,\\frac{S}{\\sqrt{n}}, \\ \\widehat{\\theta}_n^\\mathrm{MC} + q_{1-\\alpha/2}\\,\\frac{S}{\\sqrt{n}} \\bigg] . \\]\n\nExample 4.1 We continue the example of Example 2.1 and Example 3.2, where we were estimating \\(\\mathbb P(Z &gt; 2)\\) for \\(Z\\) a standard normal.\n\nn &lt;- 1e6\nsamples &lt;- rnorm(n)\nMCest   &lt;- mean(samples &gt; 2)\nRMSEest &lt;- sqrt(var(samples &gt; 2) / n)\nMCest\n\n[1] 0.022818\n\n\nOur confidence interval is estimates as follows\n\nalpha &lt;- 0.05\nquant &lt;- qnorm(1 - alpha / 2)\nc(MCest - quant * RMSEest, MCest + quant * RMSEest)\n\n[1] 0.02252533 0.02311067",

    "text": "4.3 How many samples do I need?\nIn our examples we’ve picked the number of samples \\(n\\) for our estimator, then approximated the error based on that. But we could do things the other way around – fix an error tolerance that we’re willing to deal with, then work out what sample size we need to achieve it.\nWe know that the root-mean-square error is \\[ \\operatorname{RMSE}\\big(\\widehat{\\theta}_n^{\\mathrm{MC}}\\big) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\operatorname{Var}\\big(\\phi(X)\\big)} \\] So if we want to get the RMSE down to \\(\\epsilon\\), say, then this shows that we need \\[ \\epsilon = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\operatorname{Var}\\big(\\phi(X)\\big)} .\\] Squaring both sides, multiplying both sides by \\(n\\), and dividing both sides by \\(\\epsilon^2\\) gives \\[ n = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2} \\Var\\big(\\phi(X)\\big) . \\]\nSo this tells us how many samples \\(n\\) we need. Except we still have a problem here, though. We (usually) don’t know \\(\\Var(\\phi(X))\\). But we can’t even estimate \\(\\Var(\\phi(X))\\) until we’ve already taken the samples. So it seems we’re stuck.\nBut we can use this idea with a three-step process:\n\nRun an initial “pilot” Monte Carlo algorithm with a small number of samples \\(n\\). Use the results of the “pilot” to estimate the variance \\(S^2 \\approx \\Var(\\phi(X))\\). We want \\(n\\) small enough that this runs very quickly, but big enough that we get a reasonably OK estimate of the variance.\nPick a desired RMSE accuracy \\(\\epsilon\\). We now know that we require roughly \\(N = S^2 / \\epsilon^2\\) samples to get our desired accuracy.\nRun the “real” Monte Carlo algorithm with this big number of samples \\(N\\). We will put up with this being quite slow, because we know we’re definitely going to get the error tolerance we need.\n\n(We could potentially use further steps, where we now check the variance with the “real” big-\\(N\\) samples, and, if we learn we had underestimated in Step 1, take even more samples to correct for this.)\n\nExample 4.2 Let’s try this with Example 1.2 from before. We were trying to estimate \\(\\mathbb{E}(\\sin X)\\), where \\(X \\sim \\operatorname{N}(1, 2^2)\\).\nWe’ll start with just \\(n = 1000\\) samples, for our pilot study.\n\nn_pilot &lt;- 1000\nsamples &lt;- rnorm(n_pilot, 1, 2)\nvar_est &lt;- var(sin(samples))\nvar_est\n\n[1] 0.4995853\n\n\nThis was very quick! We won’t have got a super-accurate estimate of \\(\\mathbb E\\phi(X)\\), but we have a reasonable idea of roughly what \\(\\operatorname{Var}(\\phi(X))\\) is. This will allow us to pick out “real” sample size in order to get a root-mean-square error of \\(10^{-4}\\).\n\nepsilon &lt;- 1e-4\nn_real  &lt;- round(var_est / epsilon^2)\nn_real\n\n[1] 49958529\n\n\nThis tells us that we will need about 50 million samples! This is a lot, but now we know we’re going to get the accuracy we want, so it’s worth it. (In this particular case, 50 million samples will only take a few second on a modern computer. But generally, once we know our code works and we know how many samples we will need for the desired accuracy, this is the sort of thing that we could leave running overnight or whatever.)\n\nsamples &lt;- rnorm(n_real, 1, 2)\nMCest &lt;- mean(sin(samples))\nMCest\n\n[1] 0.1138543\n\nRMSEest &lt;- sqrt(var(sin(samples)) / n_real)\nRMSEest\n\n[1] 9.873866e-05\n\n\nThis second step was quite slow (depending on the speed of the computer being used – it was only about 5 seconds on my pretty-new laptop, but slower on my ancient work desktop). But we see that we have indeed got our Monte Carlo estimate to (near enough) the desired accuracy.\n\nGenerally, if we want a more accurate Monte Carlo estimator, we can just take more samples. But the equation \\[ n = \\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2} \\Var\\big(\\phi(X)\\big) \\] is actually quite bad news. To get an RMSE of \\(\\epsilon\\) we need order \\(1/\\epsilon^2\\) samples. That’s not good. Think of it like this: to double the accuracy we need to quadruple the number of samples. Even worse: to get “one more decimal place of accuracy” means dividing \\(\\epsilon\\) by ten; but that means multiplying the number of samples by one hundred!\nMore samples take more time, and cost more energy and money. Wouldn’t it be nice to have some better ways of increasing the accuracy of a Monte Carlo estimate besides just taking more and more samples?\nNext time: We begin our study of clever “variance reduction” methods for Monte Carlo estimation.\n\nSummary:\n\nWe can approximate confidence intervals for a Monte Carlo estimate by using a normal approximation.\nTo get the root-mean-square error below \\(\\epsilon\\) we need \\(n = \\Var(\\phi(X))/\\epsilon^2\\) samples.\nWe can use a two-step process, where a small “pilot” Monte Carlo estimation allows us to work out how many samples we will need for the big “real” estimation.\n\nRead more: Voss, An Introduction to Statistical Computing, Subsections 3.2.2–3.2.4.",

So if we can’t (or don’t want to) increase \\(n\\), perhaps we can decrease the variance instead? Strategies to do this are called variance reduction strategies. In this module, we will look at three variance reduction strategies:",

    "text": "5.2 Control variate estimation\nIn Monday’s lecture, I polled the class on this question: Estimate the average time it takes to fly from London to New York.\n\nThe actual answer is: 8 hours.\nThe mean guess was: 9 hours and 38 minutes (98 minutes too much)\nThe root-mean-square error for the guesses was: 158 minutes\n\nAfter you’d guessed, I gave the following hint: Hint: The average time it takes to fly from London to Washington D.C. is 8 hours and 15 minutes. After the hint:\n\nThe mean guess was: 8 hours and 50 minutes (50 minutes too much)\nThe root-mean-square error for the guesses was: 72 minutes\n\nSo after the hint, the error of the class was reduced by 55%.\n(Incidentally, you were about 30% at guessing this than last year’s students…)\nWhy did the hint help? We were trying to estimate \\(\\theta^{\\mathrm{NY}}\\), the distance to New York. But that’s a big number, and the first estimates had a big error (over an hour, on average). After the hint, I expect most people thought something like this: “The answer \\(\\theta^{\\mathrm{NY}}\\) is going to be similar to the \\(\\theta^{\\mathrm{DC}} =\\) 8:15 to Washington D.C., but New York isn’t quite as far, so I should decrease the number a bit, but not too much.”\nTo be more mathematical, we could write \\[\\theta^{\\mathrm{NY}} = \\theta^{\\mathrm{NY}} + \\big(\\theta^{\\mathrm{DC}} - \\theta^{\\mathrm{DC}}\\big) =  \\underbrace{\\theta^{\\mathrm{DC}}\\vphantom{\\big)}}_{\\text{known}} + \\underbrace{\\big(\\theta^{\\mathrm{NY}} - \\theta^{\\mathrm{DC}}\\big)}_{\\text{small}} . \\] In that equation, the first term, \\(\\theta^{\\mathrm{DC}} =\\) 8:15 was completely known, so had error 0, while the second term \\(\\theta^{\\mathrm{NY}} - \\theta^{\\mathrm{DC}}\\) (actually minus 15 minutes) was a small number, so only had a small error.\nThis idea of improving an estimate by “anchoring” it to some known value is called controlled estimation. It is a very useful idea in statistics (and in life!).\nWe can apply this idea to Monte Carlo estimation too. Suppose we are trying to estimate \\(\\theta = \\Exg \\phi(X)\\). We could look for a function \\(\\psi\\) that is similar to \\(\\phi\\) (at least for the values of \\(x\\) that have high probability for the random variable \\(X\\)), but where we know for certain what \\(\\Exg \\psi(X)\\) is. Then we can write \\[ \\theta = \\Exg \\phi(X) = \\Exg \\big(\\phi(X) - \\psi(X) + \\psi(X)\\big) = \\underbrace{\\Exg\\big(\\phi(X) - \\psi(X)\\big)}_{\\text{estimate this with Monte Carlo}} + \\underbrace{\\Exg \\psi(X)\\vphantom{\\big)}}_{\\text{known}} . \\]\nHere, \\(\\psi(X)\\) is known as the control variate.\n\nDefinition 5.1 Let \\(X\\) be a random variable, \\(\\phi\\) a function, and write \\(\\theta = \\Exg\\phi(X)\\). Let \\(\\psi\\) be a function such that \\(\\eta = \\Exg\\psi(X)\\) is known. Suppose that \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n\\) are a random sample from \\(X\\).

But what should we pick for the control function \\(\\psi\\)? We want something that’s similar to \\(\\phi(x) = \\cos(x)\\), but where we can actually calculate the expectation.\nHere’s a suggestion. If we remember our Taylor series, we know that, for \\(x\\) near \\(0\\), \\[ \\cos x \\approx 1 - \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^4}{4!} - \\frac{x^6}{6!} + \\cdots . \\] So how about taking the first two nonzero terms in the Taylor series \\[ \\psi(x) = 1 - \\frac{x^2}{2} . \\] That is quite close to \\(\\cos x\\), at least for the values of \\(x\\) near 0 that \\(X \\sim \\operatorname{N}(0,1)\\) is most likely to take.\n\n\nCode for drawing this graph\ncurve(\n  cos(x), from = -4.5, to = 4.5,\n  col = \"blue\", lwd = 3,\n  xlab = \"x\", ylab = \"\", xlim = c(-4,4), ylim = c(-1.2,1.2)\n)\ncurve(1 - x^2 / 2, add = TRUE, col = \"red\", lwd = 2)\nlegend(\n  \"topright\", c(\"cos x\", expression(1 - x^2 / 2)),\n  lwd = c(3, 2), col = c(\"blue\", \"red\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot only that, but we know that for \\(Y \\sim \\operatorname{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) we have \\(\\Ex Y^2 = \\mu^2 + \\sigma^2\\).

This is very similar to Theorem 3.2, so we’ll just sketch the important differences.\nIn part 1, we have \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\Exg \\widehat{\\theta}_n^{\\mathrm{CV}}\n  &= \\Exg \\left(\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\big(\\phi(X_i) - \\psi(X_i)\\big)\\right) + \\eta \\\\\n  &= \\frac{1}{n}\\Exg \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\big(\\phi(X_i) - \\psi(X_i)\\big)\\right) + \\eta \\\\\n  &= \\frac{n}{n}\\Exg\\big(\\phi(X) - \\psi(X)\\big) + \\eta \\\\\n  &= \\Exg\\phi(X) - \\Exg\\psi(X) + \\eta \\\\\n  &= \\Exg\\phi(X) ,\n\\end{align*}\\] since \\(\\eta = \\Exg\\psi(X)\\). So the estimator is unbiased.\nFor part 2, remembering that \\(\\eta = \\Exg \\psi(X)\\) is a constant, so doesn’t affect the variance, we have \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\Var \\big(\\widehat{\\theta}_n^{\\mathrm{CV}}\\big)\n&= \\Var \\left(\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\big(\\phi(X_i) - \\psi(X_i)\\big) + \\eta \\right) \\\\\n&= \\Big( \\frac{1}{n}\\Big)^2 \\Var \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\big(\\phi(X_i) - \\psi(X_i)\\big) \\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{n}{n^2} \\Var \\big(\\phi(X) - \\psi(X)\\big) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{n} \\Var \\big(\\phi(X) - \\psi(X)\\big) .\n\\end{align*}\\]\nParts 3 and 4 follow in the usual way.\n\nThis tells us that a control variate Monte Carlo estimate is good when the variance of \\(\\phi(X) - \\psi(X)\\). This variance is likely to be small if \\(\\phi(X) - \\psi(X)\\) is usually small – although, to be more precise, it’s more important for \\(\\phi(X) - \\psi(X)\\) to be consistent, rather than small per se.\nAs before, we can’t usually calculate the variance \\(\\Var(\\phi(X) - \\psi(X))\\) exactly, but we can estimate it from the samples. Again, we use the sample variance of \\(\\phi(X_i) - \\psi(X_i)\\), \\[S^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\Big(\\big(\\phi(X_i) - \\psi(X_i)\\big) - \\big(\\widehat\\theta_n^{\\mathrm{CV}} - \\eta\\big)\\Big)^2 , \\] and estimate the MSE and RMSE by \\(S^2 / n\\) and \\(S / \\sqrt{n}\\) respectively.\n\nExample 5.2 We return to Example 5.1, where we were estimating \\(\\Ex \\cos(X)\\) for \\(X \\sim \\operatorname{N}(0,1)\\).\nThe naive Monte Carlo estimate had mean-square and root-mean-square error\n\nn &lt;- 1e6\nphi &lt;- function(x) cos(x)\nsamples &lt;- rnorm(n)\nMC_MSE &lt;- var(phi(samples)) / n\nc(MC_MSE, sqrt(MC_MSE))\n\n[1] 2.002769e-07 4.475231e-04\n\n\nThe variance and root-mean-square error of our control variate estimate, on the other hand, are\n\npsi &lt;- function(x) 1 - x^2 / 2\nCV_MSE &lt;- var(phi(samples) - psi(samples)) / n\nc(CV_MSE, sqrt(CV_MSE))\n\n[1] 9.327741e-08 3.054135e-04\n\n\nThis was a success!

    "text": "6.1 Estimation with correlation\nThis lecture and the next, we will be looking at our second variance reduction method for Monte Carlo estimation: the use of antithetic variables.” The word “antithetic” refers to using negative correlation to reduce the variance an estimator.\nLet’s start with the simple example of estimating an expectation from \\(n = 2\\) samples. Suppose \\(Y\\) has expectation \\(\\mu = \\Ex Y\\) and variance \\(\\Var(Y) = \\sigma^2\\). Suppose \\(Y_1\\) and \\(Y_2\\) are independent samples from \\(Y\\). Then the Monte Carlo estimator is \\[ \\overline Y = \\tfrac12(Y_1 + Y_2) . \\] This estimator is unbiased, since \\[ \\Ex \\overline Y = \\Ex \\big(\\tfrac12(Y_1 + Y_2)\\big) = \\tfrac12 ( \\Ex Y_1 + \\Ex Y_2 ) = \\tfrac12 (\\mu + \\mu) = \\mu . \\] Thus the mean-square error equals the variance, which is \\[ \\Var \\big( \\overline Y\\big) = \\Var \\big(\\tfrac12(Y_1 + Y_2)\\big) =\\tfrac14 \\big( \\Var(Y_1) + \\Var(Y_2) \\big)= \\tfrac14 (\\sigma^2 + \\sigma^2) = \\tfrac12 \\sigma^2 . \\]\nBut what if \\(Y_1\\) and \\(Y_2\\) still have the same distribution as \\(Y\\) but now are not independent?

But the variance (and hence mean-square error) is now \\[ \\Var \\big( \\overline Y\\big) = \\Var \\big(\\tfrac12(Y_1 + Y_2)\\big) =\\tfrac14 \\big( \\Var(Y_1) + \\Var(Y_2) + 2 \\Cov(Y_1, Y_2) \\big) . \\] Write \\(\\rho\\) for the correlation \\[ \\rho = \\Corr(Y_1, Y_2) = \\frac{\\Cov(Y_1, Y_2)}{\\sqrt{\\Var(Y_1) \\Var(Y_2)}} = \\frac{\\Cov(Y_1, Y_2)}{\\sqrt{\\sigma^2 \\times \\sigma^2}} = \\frac{\\Cov(Y_1, Y_2)}{\\sigma^2} . \\] (Remember that \\(-1 \\leq \\rho \\leq +1\\).) Then the variance is \\[ \\Var \\big( \\overline Y\\big) = \\tfrac14 ( \\sigma^2 + \\sigma^2 + 2 \\rho \\sigma^2 ) = \\frac{1+\\rho}{2} \\,\\sigma^2 . \\]\nWe can compare this with the variance \\(\\frac12 \\sigma^2\\) from the independent-sample case:",

    "text": "6.2 Monte Carlo with antithetic variables\nWe have seen that negative correlation helps improve estimation from \\(n=2\\) samples. How can we make this work in our favour for Monte Carlo simulation with many more samples?\nWe will look at the idea of antithetic pairs. So instead of taking \\(n\\) samples \\[ X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n \\] that are all independent of each other, we will take \\(n/2\\) pairs of samples \\[ (X_1, X'_1), (X_2, X'_2), \\dots, (X_{n/2}, X'_{n/2}) . \\] (Here, \\(n/2\\) pairs means \\(n\\) samples over all.) Within each pair, \\(X_i\\) and \\(X_i'\\) will not be independent, but between different pairs \\(i \\neq j\\), \\((X_i, X_i')\\) and \\((X_j, X'_j)\\) will be independent.\n\nDefinition 6.1 Let \\(X\\) be a random variable, \\(\\phi\\) a function, and write \\(\\theta = \\Exg\\phi(X)\\).

Let’s try\n\nn &lt;- 1e6\nsamples1 &lt;- rnorm(n / 2)\nsamples2 &lt;- -samples1\nAVest &lt;- (1 / n) * sum((samples1 &gt; 2) + (samples2 &gt; 2))\nAVest\n\n[1] 0.022743\n\n\n\n\nExample 6.2 Let’s consider estimating \\(\\mathbb E \\sin U\\), where \\(U\\) is continuous uniform on \\([0,1]\\).\nThe basic Monte Carlo estimate is\n\nn &lt;- 1e6\nsamples &lt;- runif(n)\nMCest &lt;- mean(sin(samples))\nMCest\n\n[1] 0.4596232\n\n\nWe used runif(n, min, max) to generate \\(n\\) samples on the interval \\([\\mathtt{min}, \\mathtt{max}]\\).

You should work through all the questions on this problem sheet in advance of the problems class, which takes place in the lecture of Thursday 16 October.\nThis problem sheet is to help you practice material from the module and to help you check your learning. It is not for formal assessment and does not count towards your module mark.\nHowever, if, optionally, you would like some brief informal feedback on Questions 4, 6 and 8 (marked ★), I am happy to provide some. If you want some brief feedback, you should submit your work electronically through Gradescope via the module’s Minerva page by 1400 on Tuesday 14 October. (If you hand-write solutions on paper, the easiest way to scan-and-submit that work is using the Gradescope app on your phone.) I will return some brief comments on your those two questions by the problems class on Thursday 16 October. Because this informal feedback, and not part of the official assessment, I cannot accept late work for any reason – but I am always happy to discuss any of your work on any question in my office hours.\nMany of these questions will require use of the R programming language (for example, by using the program RStudio).\nFull solutions will be released on Friday 17 October.\n\n\n\\[ \\]\n\n\n1.      Let \\(X\\) be uniform on \\([-1,2]\\).\n\n(a)   By hand, calculate the exact value of \\(\\Ex X^4\\).\n\nSolution.\n\\[\\int_{-1}^2 x^4\\,\\frac{1}{2-(-1)}\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\tfrac13 \\Big[\\tfrac15x^5\\Big]_{-1}^2 = \\tfrac13\\Big(\\tfrac{32}{5}-\\big(-\\tfrac15\\big)\\Big) = \\tfrac{33}{15} = \\tfrac{11}{5} = 2.2\\]\n\n\n\n(b)   Using R, calculate a Monte Carlo estimate for \\(\\Ex X^4\\).\n\nSolution. I used the R code\n\nn &lt;- 1e6\nsamples &lt;- runif(n, -1, 2)\nmean(samples^4)\n\n[1] 2.199236\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.      Let \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) both be standard normal distributions. Compute a Monte Carlo estimate of \\(\\Exg \\max\\{X,Y\\}\\). (You may wish to investigate R’s pmax() function.)\n\nSolution. By looking at ?pmax (or maybe searching on Google) I discovered that pmax() gives the “parallel maxima” of two (or more vectors). That is the first element is the maximum of all the first elements of the vectors; the second element is the maximum of all the second elements of the vectors; and so on.\nSo I used the R code\n\nn &lt;- 1e6\nxsamples &lt;- rnorm(n)\nysamples &lt;- rnorm(n)\nmean(pmax(xsamples, ysamples))\n\n[1] 0.5645173\n\n\n\n\n\n3.      You are trapped alone on an island. All you have with you is a tin can (radius \\(r\\)) and a cardboard box (side lengths \\(2r \\times 2r\\)) that it fits snugly inside. You put the can inside the box [left picture].\nWhen it starts raining, each raindrop that falls in the cardboard box might fall into the tin can [middle picture], or might fall into the corners of the box outside the can [right picture].\n\n\n(a)   Using R, simulate rainfall into the box. You may take units such that \\(r = 1\\). Estimate the probability \\(\\theta\\) that a uniformly-random raindrop that falls in the cardboard box falls into the tin can also.\n\nSolution. I set things up so that the box is \\([-1, 1]^2\\), centered at the origin. This means that the inside of the can is the set of points is those \\((x,y)\\) such that \\(x^2 + y^2 \\leq 1\\).\n\nn &lt;- 1e6\nrain_x &lt;- runif(n, -1, 1)\nrain_y &lt;- runif(n, -1, 1)\nin_box &lt;- function(x, y) x^2 + y^2 &lt;= 1\nmean(in_box(rain_x, rain_y))\n\n[1] 0.785022\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)   Calculate exactly the probability \\(\\theta\\).\n\nSolution. The area of the box is \\(2r \\times 2r = 4r^2\\). The area of the can is \\(\\pi r^2\\). So the probability a raindrop landing in the box lands in the can is \\[ \\frac{\\text{area of can}}{\\text{area of box}} = \\frac{\\pi r^2}{4r^2} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\approx 0.785. \\]\n\n\n\n(c)   You realise that, despite being trapped all alone on the island, you now have a way of approximating the value of \\(\\pi\\). If you want to calculate \\(\\pi\\) to 6 decimal places, roughly how many raindrops do you need to fall into the box?\n\nSolution. The phrase “to 6 decimal places” isn’t a precise mathematical one. I’m going to interpret this as getting the root-mean-square error below \\(10^{-6}\\). If you interpret it slightly differently that’s fine – for example, getting the width of a 95% confidence interval below \\(10^{-6}\\) could be another, slightly stricter, criterion.\nOne could work this out by hand. Since the variance of a Bernoulli random variable is \\(p(1-p)\\), the mean-square error of our estimator is \\[ \\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{4}(1 - \\frac{\\pi}{4})}{n} \\approx \\frac{0.169}{n} . \\] So we need \\[n = \\frac{0.169}{(10^{-6})^2} \\approx 169 \\text{ billion} . \\]\nThat said, if we are trapped on our desert island, maybe we don’t know what \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}(1 - \\frac{\\pi}{4})\\) is. In that case we could do this using the can and the box. Our estimate of the variance is\n\nvar_est &lt;- var(in_box(rain_x, rain_y))\nvar_est / (1e-6)^2\n\n[1] 168762628281\n\n\nWe will probably spend a long time waiting for that much rain!\n\n\n\n\n4.     ★ (2024–25 exam, Question 1(d)) A statistician wants to estimate \\(\\mathbb E(\\cos X)\\), where \\(X \\sim \\operatorname{Exp(4)}\\) is an exponential distribution with rate 4. The statistician begins with a pilot study, as shown in the R session below:\n\n   &gt; n &lt;- 1e4\n&gt; samples &lt;- rexp(n, 4)\n&gt; var(cos(samples))\n[1] 0.01416\n\n            The statistician wants to get the root-mean-square error of her estimator down to \\(10^{−4}\\). Approximately how many samples will she need for the full study? Explain your answer.\n\n\n5.      Let \\(h(x) = 1/(x + 0.1)\\). We wish to estimate \\(\\int_0^5 h(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x\\) using a Monte Carlo method.\n\n(a)   Estimate the integral using \\(X\\) uniform on \\([0,5]\\).\n\nSolution.\n\nn &lt;- 1e6\nintegrand &lt;- function(x) 1 / (x + 0.1)\nsamples1 &lt;- runif(n, 0, 5)\nmean(5 * integrand(samples1))\n\n[1] 3.928643\n\n\n(In fact, the true answer is \\(\\log(5.1) - \\log(0.1) = 3.932\\), so it looks like this is working correctly.)\n\n\n\n(b)   Can you come up with a choice of \\(X\\) that improves on the estimate from (a)?\n\nSolution. Let’s look at a graph of the integrand \\(h\\).\n\n\nCode for drawing this graph\ncurve(\n  integrand, n = 1001, from = 0, to = 5,\n  col = \"blue\", lwd = 3,\n  xlab = \"x\", ylab = \"integrand h(x)\", xlim = c(0,5)\n)\nabline(h = 0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that we get a much bigger contribution to the integral from values near 0. So a random variable that picks values nearer to 0 more often might have a chance of giving a more accurate result.\n\nI decided to try an exponential distribution with rate 1, which should sample the smaller values of \\(x\\) more often.\n\npdf &lt;- function(x) dexp(x, 1)\nphi &lt;- function(x) (integrand(x) / pdf(x)) * (x &lt;= 5)\n\nsamples2 &lt;- rexp(n, 1)\nmean(phi(samples2))\n\n[1] 3.932641\n\n\n(I had to include x &lt;= 5 in the expression for \\(\\phi\\), because my exponential distribution will sometimes take samples above 5, but they should count as 0 in an estimate for the integral between 0 and 5.)\nTo see whether or not this was an improvement, I estimated the mean-square error.\n\nvar(5 * integrand(samples1)) / n\n\n[1] 3.341696e-05\n\nvar(phi(samples2)) / n\n\n[1] 6.064075e-06\n\n\nI found that I had reduced the mean-square error by roughly a factor of 5. \n\n\n\n\n\n6.      ★ Show that the indicator functions \\(\\mathbb I_A(X)\\) and \\(\\mathbb I_B(X)\\) have correlation 0 if and only if the events \\(\\{X \\in A\\}\\) and \\(\\{X \\in B\\}\\) are independent.\n\nSolution. Recall that two random variables \\(U\\), \\(V\\) have correlation 0 if and only if their covariance \\(\\Cov(U,V) = \\Ex UV - (\\Ex U)(\\Ex V)\\) is 0 too.\nWe know that \\(\\Exg\\Ind_A(X) = \\mathbb P(X \\in A)\\) and \\(\\Exg \\Ind_B(Y) = \\mathbb P(X \\in B)\\). What about \\(\\Exg \\Ind_A(X) \\Ind_B(X)\\)? Well, \\(\\Ind_A(x) \\Ind_B(x)\\) is 1 if and only if both indicator functions equal 1, which is if and only if both \\(x \\in A\\) and \\(x \\in B\\). So \\(\\Exg \\Ind_A(X) \\Ind_B(X) = \\mathbb P(X \\in A \\text{ and } X \\in B)\\).\nSo the covariance is \\[ \\Cov \\big(\\Ind_A(X), \\Ind_B(X) \\big) = \\mathbb P(X \\in A \\text{ and } X \\in B) - \\mathbb P(X \\in A)\\, \\mathbb P(X \\in B) . \\] If this is 0, then \\(\\mathbb P(X \\in A \\text{ and } X \\in B) = \\mathbb P(X \\in A)\\, \\mathbb P(X \\in B)\\), which is precisely the definition of those two events being independent.\n\n\n\n7.      Let \\(X\\) be an exponential distribution with rate 1.\n\n(a)   Estimate \\(\\mathbb EX^{2.1}\\) using the standard Monte Carlo method.\n\n\nn &lt;- 1e6\nsamples &lt;- rexp(n, 1)\nmean(samples^2.1)\n\n[1] 2.19966\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)   Estimate \\(\\mathbb EX^{2.1}\\) using \\(X^2\\) as a control variate. (You may recall that if \\(Y\\) is exponential with rate \\(\\lambda\\) then \\(\\mathbb EY^2 = 2/\\lambda^2\\).)\n\nSolution. We have \\(\\Ex X^2 = 2\\). So, re-using the same sample as before (you don’t have to do this – you could take new samples), our R code is as follows.\n\nmean(samples^2.1 - samples^2) + 2\n\n[1] 2.198221\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)   Which method is better?\n\nSolution. The better answer is the one with the smaller mean-square error.\nFor the basic method,\n\nvar(samples^2.1) / n\n\n[1] 2.807748e-05\n\n\nFor the control variate method,\n\nvar(samples^2.1 - samples^2) / n\n\n[1] 6.881275e-07\n\n\nSo the control variates method is much, much better.\n\n\n\n\n8.      ★ Let \\(Z\\) be a standard normal distribution. A statistician has been investigating Monte Carlo estimates of \\(\\mathbb EZ^k\\) for different positive integers values of \\(k\\). Her colleague suggests using \\(Z' = -Z\\) as an antithetic variable. Without running any R code, explain whether or not this is a good idea (a) when \\(k\\) is even; (b) when \\(k\\) is odd.\n\nSolution.\n(a) When \\(k\\) is even, we have \\(Z^k = (-Z)^k\\). So the antithetic variables method just repeats each sample twice. This is obviously no benefit at all, and just wastes time. Indeed, we have perfect positive correlation \\(\\rho = +1\\), which is the “worst-case scenario”.\n(b) When \\(k\\) is odd, we have \\(Z^k = -(-Z)^k\\). In this case we know that \\(\\Ex Z^k = 0\\), because the results for positive \\(z\\) exactly balance out those for negative \\(z\\), so no Monte Carlo sampling is necessary. If our statistician has somehow forgotten that, though, she will get a pleasant surprise! After just two samples, she will get the estimate \\[\\frac{1}{2} \\big(Z_1^k + (-Z_1)^k \\big) = \\frac{1}{2} (Z_1^k - Z_1^k) = 0 ,\\] Thereby getting the result exactly right. Indeed, we have perfect negative correlation \\(\\rho = -1\\), which is the “best-case scenario”.",

    "section": "7.2 Finding antithetic variables",
    "text": "7.2 Finding antithetic variables\nAntithetic variables can provide a huge advantage compared to standard Monte Carlo, as we saw in the second example above. The downside is that it can often be difficult to find an appropriate antithetic variable.\nTo even be able to try the antithetic variables method, we need to find a random variable \\(X'\\) with the same distribution as \\(X\\) that isn’t merely an independent copy. Both the examples we have seen of this use a symmetric distribution; that is, a distribution \\(X\\) such that \\(X' = a - X\\) has the same distribution as \\(X\\), for some \\(a\\).\n\nWe saw that if \\(X \\sim \\operatorname{N}(0, 1)\\) is a standard normal distribution, then \\(X' = -X \\sim \\operatorname{N}(0, 1)\\) too. More generally, if \\(X\\sim \\operatorname{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\), then \\(X' = 2\\mu - X \\sim \\operatorname{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) can be tried as an antithetic variable.\nWe saw that if \\(U \\sim \\operatorname{U}[0, 1]\\) is a continuous uniform distribution on \\([0,1]\\), then \\(U' = 1-U \\sim \\operatorname{U}[0, 1]\\) too. More generally, if \\(X\\sim \\operatorname{U}[a, b]\\), then \\(X' = (a + b) - X \\sim \\operatorname{U}[a, b]\\) can be tried as an antithetic variable.\n\nLater, when we study the inverse transform method (in Lecture 13) we will see another, more general, way to generate antithetic variables.\nBut to be a good antithetic variable, we need \\(\\phi(X)\\) and \\(\\phi(X')\\) to be negatively correlated too – preferably strongly so. Often, this is a matter of trial-and-error – it’s difficult to set out hard principles. But there are some results that try to formalise the idea that “nice functions of negatively correlated random variables are themselves negatively correlated”, which can be useful. We give one example of such a result here.\n\nTheorem 7.2 Let \\(U \\sim \\operatorname{U}[0, 1]\\) and \\(V = 1 - U\\). Let \\(\\phi\\) be a monotonically increasing function. Then \\(\\phi(U)\\) and \\(\\phi(V)\\) are negatively correlated, in that \\(\\operatorname{Cov}\\big(\\phi(U), \\phi(V)\\big) \\leq 0\\).\n\nI didn’t get to this proof in the lecture and it’s a bit tricky (although not very technically deep), so let’s say it’s non-examinable.\n\nProof. [Non-examinable]  You probably already know two different expressions for the covariance: \\[ \\operatorname{Cov}(Y, Z) = \\Exg (Y - \\mu_Y)(Z - \\mu_Z) = \\Exg YZ - \\mu_Y \\mu_Z . \\] But for this proof it will be helpful to use a third, less well-known equation: \\[ \\operatorname{Cov}(Y, Z) = \\tfrac12 \\Exg (Y - Y')(Z - Z') , \\] where \\((Y', Z')\\) is an IID copy of \\((Y, Z)\\).\nTo see that this third expression is true, we can start by expanding out the brackets. We get \\[ \\tfrac12 \\Exg (Y - Y')(Z - Z')  = \\tfrac12 \\big( \\Exg YZ - \\Exg YZ' - \\Exg Y'Z + \\Exg Y'Z' \\big) . \\] We have four terms to deal with. The first has no dashed variables, so can stay as it is. The second and third terms have one dashed and one non-dashed variable, so these are independent, and we can write \\(\\Exg YZ' = \\Exg Y'Z = \\mu_Y \\mu_Z\\). The fourth term has both terms dashed, but these have the same distribution as if they were non-dashed, so \\(\\Exg Y'Z' = \\Exg YZ\\). All together, we have \\[ \\tfrac12 \\Exg (Y - Y')(Z - Z') = \\tfrac12 \\big(2\\Exg YZ - 2\\mu_Y\\mu_Z \\big) = \\Exg YZ - \\mu_Y\\mu_Z , \\] which is indeed the second expression for the covariance.\nWe can now apply this to the theorem in question. Put \\(Y = \\phi(U)\\) and \\(Z = \\phi(1-U)\\), and introduce an IID copy \\(V\\) of \\(U\\), so \\(Y' = \\phi(V)\\) and \\(Z' = \\phi(1 - V)\\). Then we have \\[  \\operatorname{Cov}\\big(\\phi(U), \\phi(V)\\big) = \\tfrac 12 \\Exg \\big(\\phi(U) - \\phi(V)\\big)\\big(\\phi(1-U) - \\phi(1-V)\\big) .\\]\nWe now claim that this expectation is negative. In fact, we have a stronger result: \\[\\big(\\phi(U) - \\phi(V)\\big)\\big(\\phi(1-U) - \\phi(1-V)\\big) \\tag{7.1}\\] is always negative, so its expectation certainly is. To see this, think separately of the two cases \\(U \\leq V\\) and \\(V \\leq U\\).\n\nIf \\(U \\leq V\\), then \\(\\phi(U) \\leq \\phi(V)\\) too, since \\(\\phi\\) is increasing. But, also this means that \\(1-U \\geq 1-V\\), so \\(\\phi(1 - U) \\geq \\phi(1-V)\\). This means that, in Equation 7.1, the first term is negative and the second term is positive, so the product is negative.\nIf \\(V \\leq U\\), then \\(\\phi(V) \\leq \\phi(U)\\) too, since \\(\\phi\\) is increasing. But, also this means that \\(1-V \\geq 1-U\\), so \\(\\phi(1 - V) \\geq \\phi(1-U)\\). This means that, in Equation 7.1, the first term is positive and the second term is negative, so the product is negative.\n\nThis completes the proof.",

    "text": "7.3 A note on sample size comparisons\nThroughout these two lectures, when using antithetic pairs, we have taken \\(n/2\\) pairs of samples. This is because that means we have \\(n/2 \\times 2 = n\\) samples all together, which seems like a fair comparison to usual Monte Carlo with \\(n\\) samples. This is certainly the case if generating the sample and generating its antithetic pair cost roughly the same in terms of time (or energy, or money). This is always how we will compare methods in this module.\nHowever, if generating the first variate of each pair is slow, but then generating the second antithetic variate is much quicker, it might be a fairer comparison to take a full \\(n\\) pairs. This could happen if we use a complicated method (like we will discover later in the module) for generating the \\(X\\), but then the \\(X'\\) is something similar like \\(X' = -X\\). You could even consider more complicated ways of assessing the “cost” of Monte Carlo estimation, by assigning different costs to generating the original sample and to the antithetic pair, and also a cost to applying the function \\(\\phi\\); but we won’t get into that here.\nNext time: We come to the third, and most important, variance reduction scheme: importance sampling.\n\nSummary:\n\nThe antithetic variables estimator is unbiased and has mean-square error \\[ \\operatorname{MSE}\\big(\\widehat{\\theta}_n^{\\mathrm{AV}}\\big) = \\frac{1}{2n} \\operatorname{Var}\\big(\\phi(X) + \\phi(X')\\big) = \\frac{1+\\rho}{n}\\Var\\big(\\phi(X)\\big). \\]\nIf \\(U \\sim \\operatorname{U}[0, 1]\\) and \\(\\phi\\) is monotonically increasing, then \\(\\phi(U)\\) and \\(\\phi(1-U)\\) are negatively correlated.\n\nOn Thursday’s lecture, we will be discussing your answers to Problem Sheet 1.\nRead more: Voss, An Introduction to Statistical Computing, Subsection 3.3.2.",

    "text": "8.1 Sampling from other distributions\nSo far, we have looked at estimating \\(\\Exg \\phi(X)\\) using samples \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n\\) that are from the same distribution as \\(X\\). Importance sampling is based on the idea of taking samples \\(Y_1, Y_2, \\dots, Y_n\\) from some different distribution \\(Y\\), but then making an appropriate adjustment, so that we’re still estimating \\(\\Exg \\phi(X)\\).\nWhy might we want to do this? There are two main reasons:\nConsider, for example, trying to estimate \\(\\Exg\\phi(X)\\) where \\(X\\) is uniform on \\([0, 20]\\) and \\(\\phi\\) is the function shown below.\nCode for drawing this graph\nphi &lt;- function(x) sin(5 * x) / (5 * x)\ncurve(\n  phi, n = 10001, from = 0, to = 20,\n  lwd = 3, col = \"blue\",\n  xlab = \"x\", ylab = expression(phi(x)), ylim = c(-0.2, 1)\n)\nabline(h = 0)\nWe can see that what happens for small \\(x\\) – say, for \\(x\\) between 0 and 2, or so – will have an important effect on the value of \\(\\Exg \\phi(X)\\), because that where \\(\\phi\\) has the biggest (absolute) values. But what happens for large \\(x\\) – say for \\(x \\geq 10\\) or so – will be much less important for estimating \\(\\Exg\\phi(X)\\). So it seems wasteful to have all values in \\([0, 20]\\) to be sampled equally, and it would seem to make sense to take more samples from small values of \\(x\\).\nThis is all very well in practice, but how exactly should we down-weight those over-sampled areas?\nThink about estimating \\(\\Exg \\phi(X)\\). Let’s assume that \\(X\\) is continuous with probability density function \\(f\\). (Throughout this lecture and the next, we will assume all our random variables are continuous. The arguments for discrete random variables are very similar – just swap probability density functions with probability mass functions and integrals with sums. You can fill in the details yourself, if you like.) Then we are trying to estimate \\[ \\Exg \\phi(X) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\phi(x)\\,f(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\phi(y)\\,f(y)\\,\\mathrm{d}y . \\] (In the second equality, we merely changed the “dummy variable” from \\(x\\) to \\(y\\), as we are at liberty to do.)\nNow suppose we sample from some other continuous distribution \\(Y\\), with PDF \\(g\\). If we estimate \\(\\Exg \\psi(Y)\\), say, for some function \\(\\psi\\), then we are estimating \\[\\Exg \\psi(Y) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\psi(y)\\,g(y) \\, \\mathrm{d}y = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\psi(x)\\,g(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x . \\]\nBut we want to be estimating \\(\\Exg\\phi(X)\\), not \\(\\Exg\\psi(Y)\\). So we will need to pick \\(\\psi\\) such that \\[ \\Exg \\phi(X) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\phi(y)\\,f(y)\\,\\mathrm{d}y = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\psi(y)\\,g(y) \\, \\mathrm{d}y = \\Exg \\psi(Y) . \\] So we need to pick \\(\\psi\\) such that \\(\\phi(y)\\,f(y) = \\psi(y)\\,g(y)\\). That means that we should take \\[\\psi(y) = \\frac{\\phi(y) f(y)}{g(y)} = \\frac{f(y)}{g(y)}\\,\\phi(y). \\]\nSo we could build a Monte Carlo estimate for \\(\\Exg \\phi(X)\\) instead as a Monte Carlo estimate for \\[ \\Exg \\psi(Y) = \\Exg \\left(\\frac{f(Y)}{g(Y)}\\,\\phi(Y) \\right) . \\]\nThere is one other thing: we need to be careful of division by \\(0\\) errors. So we should make sure that \\(g\\) is only 0 when \\(f\\) is 0. In other words, if it’s possible for \\(X\\) to take some value, then it must be possible for \\(Y\\) to take that value too.\nWe are finally ready to define our estimator.\nWe can think of this as taking a weighted mean of the \\(\\phi(Y_i)\\)s, where the weights are \\(f(Y_i)/g(Y_i)\\). So if a value \\(y\\) is more likely under \\(Y\\) than under \\(X\\), then \\(g(y)\\) is big compared to \\(f(y)\\), so \\(f(y)/g(y)\\) is small, and \\(y\\) gets a low weight. If a value \\(y\\) is less likely under \\(Y\\) than under \\(X\\), then \\(g(y)\\) is small compared to \\(f(y)\\), so \\(f(y) / g(y)\\) is big, and it gets a high weight. Thus we see that the weighting compensates for values that are likely to be over- or under-sampled.",

Then:\n\n\\(\\widehat{\\theta}_n^{\\mathrm{IS}}\\) is unbiased, in that \\(\\operatorname{bias}\\big(\\widehat{\\theta}_n^{\\mathrm{IS}}\\big) = 0\\).\nThe variance of of \\(\\widehat{\\theta}_n^{\\mathrm{IS}}\\) is \\[ \\operatorname{Var}\\big(\\widehat{\\theta}_n^{\\mathrm{IS}}\\big) = \\frac{1}{n} \\operatorname{Var}\\left( \\frac{f(Y)}{g(Y)}\\,\\phi(Y) \\right). \\]\nThe mean-square error of \\(\\widehat{\\theta}_n^{\\mathrm{IS}}\\) is \\[ \\operatorname{MSE}\\big(\\widehat{\\theta}_n^{\\mathrm{IS}}\\big) = \\frac{1}{n} \\operatorname{Var}\\left( \\frac{f(Y)}{g(Y)}\\,\\phi(Y) \\right) . \\]\nThe root-mean-square error of \\(\\widehat{\\theta}_n^{\\mathrm{IS}}\\) is \\[ \\operatorname{RMSE}\\big(\\widehat{\\theta}_n^{\\mathrm{IS}}\\big) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\,\\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}\\left( \\frac{f(Y)}{g(Y)}\\,\\phi(Y) \\right)}. \\]\n\n\n\nProof. Part 1 follows essentially the same argument as our discussion at the beginning of this lecture. We have \\[ \\Ex \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{f(Y_i)}{g(Y_i)}\\,\\phi(Y_i) \\right) = \\frac{1}{n}\\, n\\, \\Ex \\left(\\frac{f(Y)}{g(Y)}\\,\\phi(Y)\\right) = \\Ex \\left(\\frac{f(Y)}{g(Y)}\\,\\phi(Y)\\right) . \\] But \\[ \\Ex \\left(\\frac{f(Y)}{g(Y)}\\,\\phi(Y)\\right) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\frac{f(y)}{g(y)}\\,\\phi(y)\\,g(y)\\,\\mathrm{d}y = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\phi(y) \\, f(y) \\, \\mathrm{d}y = \\Exg \\phi(X) . \\] This last step is because \\(f\\) is the PDF of \\(X\\); it doesn’t matter whether the dummy variable in the integration is \\(x\\) or \\(y\\). Hence the estimator is unbiased.\nParts 2 to 4 follow in the usual way.\n\nAs we are now used to, we can estimate the variance using the sample variance.\n\nExample 8.2 We continue Example 8.1, where we are estimating \\(\\mathbb P(X &gt; 4)\\) for \\(X \\sim \\operatorname{N}(0,1)\\).\nFor the standard Monte Carlo method, we estimate the root-mean-square error as\n\nn &lt;- 1e5\nMC_MSE &lt;- var(rnorm(n) &gt; 4) / n\nsqrt(MC_MSE)\n\n[1] 2.236023e-05\n\n\nAs before, this still varies a lot, but it seems to usually be about \\(2 \\times 10^{-5}\\).\nFor the importance sampling method, we estimate the mean-square error as\n\nn &lt;- 1e5\npdf_x &lt;- function(x) dnorm(x, 0, 1)\npdf_y &lt;- function(y) dnorm(y, 4, 1)\nsamples_y &lt;- rnorm(n, 4, 1)\nIS_MSE &lt;- var((pdf_x(samples_y) / pdf_y(samples_y)) * (samples_y &gt; 4)) / n\nsqrt(IS_MSE)\n\n[1] 2.131441e-07\n\n\nThis is about \\(2 \\times 10^{-7}\\). This is about 100 times smaller than for the standard method: equivalent to taking about 10,000 times as many samples! That’s a huge improvement, which demonstrates the power of importance sampling.\n\nNext time: We continue our study of importance sampling – and complete our study of Monte Carlo estimation, for now – by considering how to pick a good distribution \\(Y\\).\n\nSummary:\n\nImportance sampling estimates \\(\\Exg \\phi(X)\\) by sampling from a different distribution \\(Y\\).\nThe importance sampling estimator is \\({\\displaystyle \\widehat{\\theta}_n^{\\mathrm{IS}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{f(Y_i)}{g(Y_i)}\\,\\phi(Y_i)}\\).\nThe importance sampling estimator is unbiased with mean-square error \\[ \\operatorname{MSE}\\big(\\widehat{\\theta}_n^{\\mathrm{IS}}\\big) = \\frac{1}{n} \\operatorname{Var}\\left( \\frac{f(Y)}{g(Y)}\\,\\phi(Y) \\right) . \\]\n\nSolutions are now available for Problem Sheet 1.\nRead more: Voss, An Introduction to Statistical Computing, Subsection 3.3.1.",

    "text": "9.1 Picking a good distribution\nLet’s remind ourselves where we’ve got to on importance sampling.\nWe’ve seen that importance sampling can be a very powerful tool, when used well. But how should pick a good distribution \\(Y\\) to sample from?\nLet’s examine the mean-square error more carefully: \\[ \\operatorname{MSE}\\big(\\widehat{\\theta}_n^{\\mathrm{IS}}\\big) = \\frac{1}{n} \\operatorname{Var}\\left( \\frac{f(Y)}{g(Y)}\\,\\phi(Y) \\right) . \\] So our goal is to try and pick \\(Y\\) such that \\(\\frac{f(Y)}{g(Y)}\\phi(Y)\\) has low variance. We also, of course, want to be able to sample from \\(Y\\).\nThe best possible choice, then, would be to pick \\(Y\\) such that \\(\\frac{f(Y)}{g(Y)}\\phi(Y)\\) is constant – and therefore has zero variance! If \\(\\phi\\) is non-negative, then it seems like we should pick \\(Y\\) such that its probability density function is \\(g(y) \\propto f(y)\\phi(y)\\). (Here, \\(\\propto\\) is the “proportional to” symbol.) That is, to have \\[ g(y) = \\frac{1}{Z} f(y)\\phi(y) , \\] for some constant \\(Z\\). Then \\(\\frac{f(Y)}{g(Y)}\\phi(Y) = Z\\) is a constant, has zero variance, and we have a perfect estimator!\nWhat is this constant \\(Z\\)? Well, \\(g\\) is a PDF, so it has to integrate to 1. So we will need to have \\[ 1 = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} g(y)\\, \\mathrm{d}y = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\frac{1}{Z} f(y)\\phi(y) \\, \\mathrm{d}y = \\frac{1}{Z} \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} f(x)\\phi(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{1}{Z} \\Exg\\phi(X) . \\] (We did the “switching the dummy variable from \\(y\\) to \\(x\\)” thing again.) So \\(Z = \\Exg \\phi(X)\\). But that’s no good: \\(\\theta = \\Exg \\phi(X)\\) was the thing we were trying to estimate in the first place. If we knew that, we wouldn’t have to do Monte Carlo estimation to start with!\nSo, as much as we would like to, we can’t use this “perfect” ideal distribution \\(Y\\). More generally, if \\(\\phi\\) is not always non-negative, it can be shown that \\(g(y) \\propto f(y)\\,|\\phi(y)| = |f(x)\\,\\phi(x)|\\) would be the best possible distribution, but this has the same problems.\nHowever, we can still be guided by this idea – we would like \\(g(y)\\) to be as close to proportional to \\(f(y) \\phi(y)\\) (or \\(|f(y) \\phi(y)|\\)) as we can manage, so that \\(\\frac{f(y)}{g(y)}\\phi(y)\\) is close to being constant, so hopefully has low variance. This tells us that \\(Y\\) should be likely – that is, \\(g(y)\\) should be big – where both \\(f\\) and \\(|\\phi|\\) are both big – that is, where \\(X\\) is likely and also \\(\\phi\\) is big in absolute value. While \\(Y\\) should be unlikely where both \\(X\\) is unlikely and \\(\\phi\\) is small in absolute value.\nAside from the exact theory, in the absence of any better idea, choosing \\(Y\\) to be “in the same distribution family as \\(X\\) but with different parameters” is often a reasonable thing to try.

    "section": "10.2 Random numbers on computers",
    "text": "10.2 Random numbers on computers\nWe start by considering the question of how to generate a uniform random number between 0 and 1.\nThe first thing to know is that computers do not perfectly store exact real numbers in decimals of unending length – that’s impossible! Instead, it stores a number to a certain accuracy, in terms of the number of decimal places. To be more precise, computers store numbers in binary; that is, written as a sequence of 0s and 1s. These 0s and 1s are called “binary digits”, or bits, for short. (In the presentation here, we will somewhat simplify matters – computer science experts will be able to spot where I’m lying, or “gently smoothing out the truth”.)\nA number between 0 and 1 could be (approximately) stored as a 32-bit binary number, for example. A 32-bit number is a number like\n0. 00110100 11110100 10001111 10011001\nthat is “0.” followed by a string of 32 binary digits. A string \\(0.x_1x_2\\cdots x_{31}x_{32}\\) represents the number \\[ x = \\sum_{i=1}^{32} x_i 2^{-i} . \\] So the number above represents \\[\\begin{align} &0\\times 2^{-1} + 0 \\times 2^{-2} + 1 \\times 2^{-3} + \\cdots + 0 \\times 2^{-31} + 1 \\times 2^{-32} \\\\ &\\qquad\\qquad {}=2^{-3} + 2^{-4} + 2^{-6} + \\dots + 2^{-29} + 2^{-32} \\\\ &\\qquad\\qquad {}= 0.20685670361854135990142822265625.\\end{align}\\]\nWe could generate such a 32-bit (or, more generally, \\(b\\)-bit) number in two different ways:\n\nA sequence of 32 0s and 1s (each being 50:50 likely to be 0 or 1 and each being independent of the others). This then represents a number in its binary expansion, as above.\n\nOr, more generally, we want a string of \\(b\\) 0s and 1s.\n\nA integer at random between \\(0\\) and \\(2^{32} - 1\\), which we can then divide by \\(2^{32}\\) to get a number between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\).\n\nOr, more generally, we want a random integer between \\(0\\) and \\(m - 1\\) for some \\(m\\), which we can then divide by \\(m\\). Usually \\(m = 2^b\\) for some \\(b\\), to give a \\(b\\)-bit number.\n\n\nThere are two ways we can do this. First, we can use true physical randomness. Second, we can use computer-generated “pseudorandomness”.\nTrue physical randomness means randomness from some real-life random process. For example, you could toss a coin 32 times, and write down “1” each time it lands heads and “0” each time it lands tails: this would give a random 32-bit number. While this will be genuinely random, it is, of course, very slow if you need a large amount of randomness. For example, when we have done Monte Carlo estimation, we have often used one million random numbers, which took R about 1 second – it’s obviously completely infeasible to toss 32 million coins that quickly!\nFor a greater amount of physical randomness more quickly, one could look at times between the decay of radioactive particles, thermal noise in electrical circuits, the behaviour of photons in a laser beam, and so on. But these are quite expensive, and even these may not be quick enough for some applications.\nThe bad news about true physical randomness is that it is typically slow and expensive. But the good news is that we know it will definitely be perfectly random with no hidden patterns. (For Monte Carlo, we probably are happy simply to avoid any “obvious” patterns; but for uses in cryptography, for example, true perfect randomness ensuring no patterns that an enemy could exploit can be very important.)\nHere’s a cool video by the YouTuber Tom Scott about an internet company that uses a wall of lava lamps for their true physical randomness:",

(“Pseudo” is a prefix that means something like “appears to be, even though it’s not”.) The best thing about PRNGs is because they are simple computer programs they run very very quickly and cheaply.\nMany pseudorandom number generators work by applying a recurrence; that is, applying a function again and again. Suppose we want (pseudo)random integers between \\(0\\) and \\(m-1\\). Then we have a seed \\(x_1\\), which behaves as a starting point for the sequence, and a function \\(f\\) from \\(\\{0, 1, \\dots, m-1\\}\\) to \\(\\{0, 1, \\dots, m-1\\}\\). Then starting from \\(x_1\\), we apply \\(f\\) to get the next number in the sequence \\(x_2 = f(x_1)\\). Then we apply \\(f\\) to that, to get the next point \\(x_3 = f(x_2)\\). Then apply \\(f\\) to that to get the next number, and so on. So the sequence would be \\[\\begin{align} x_1& & x_2 &= f(x_1) & x_3 &= f(x_2) = f(f(x_1)) \\\\\nx_4 &= f(x_3) = f(f(f(x_1))) & &\\cdots & x_{i+1} &= f(x_i) =f(f(\\cdots (f(x_1))\\cdots))\\end{align}\\] and so on.\nSome functions \\(f\\) would be not produce a very random-looking sequence of numbers: think of a silly example like \\(f(x) = (x+1) \\bmod m\\), so \\(x_{i+1} = (x_i + 1) \\bmod m\\) just increases by 1 each time, before “wrapping around” back to 0 when it gets to \\(m\\). (The “mod \\(m\\)” means to wrap around when you get to \\(m\\), or to take the remainder when you divide by \\(m\\).) But mathematicians have come up with lots of examples of functions \\(f\\) which, for all possible practical purposes, seem to have outputs that appear just as random as an actual random sequence.\nOne example of such a function \\(f\\) would be \\(f(x) = (ax+c) \\bmod m\\), so \\(x_{i+1} = (ax_i + c)\\bmod m\\), which can be a very good PRNG for some values of \\(a\\) and \\(c\\). In this case, the PRNG is known as a linear congruential generator (or LCG). We’ll talk more about LCGs in the next lecture.\nR’s default method is of this form – well, it’s almost a recurrence of the form \\(x_{i+1} = f(x_i)\\). It actually uses a method called the Mersenne Twister, which uses a recurrence of the form \\(x_{i+1} = (g(x_i) + i) \\bmod m\\) for a complicated function \\(g\\); here the “plus \\(i\\)”, where \\(i\\) is the step number, means we have a slightly different update rule each timestep.\nBut how do we pick the seed – the starting point \\(x_1\\)? Normally, we use some true physical randomness to pick the seed. The benefit here is that just a small amount of true physical randomness can “start you off” by choosing the seed, and then the PRNG can produces huge amounts of pseudorandomness incredibly quickly. Indeed, that’s what the wall of lava lamps in the video did – the lava lamps were just for producing lots of seeds for the PRNGs.\nHowever, it is possible, and sometimes desirable, to set the seed “by hand”. This is useful if you want to produce the same “random-looking” numbers as someone else (or yourself, previously). This is because if two people set the same seed \\(x_1\\), then the numbers \\(x_2, x_3, \\dots\\) produced after that will still appear to be random, but because the process is completely deterministic after the seed is chosen, both people will actually produce exactly the same sequence of numbers. This can be useful for checking accuracy of code, for example, or ensuring “reproducible analysis”.\nIn R, by default, the seed is set based the current time on your computer, measured down to about 10 milliseconds. However, you can set the seed yourself, using set.seed(). For example, the following code sets the seed to be 123456, then generates 10 uniform pseudorandom numbers.\n\nset.seed(123456)\nrunif(10)\n\n [1] 0.79778432 0.75356509 0.39125568 0.34155670 0.36129411 0.19834473\n [7] 0.53485796 0.09652624 0.98784694 0.16756948\n\n\nThose numbers certainly appear to be random. But if you run those two lines of code on your computer, you should get exactly the same 10 numbers that I got. That’s because you will also start with the same seed 123456, and then R will run the same pseudorandom – that is, completely deterministic – function to generate the next 10 numbers.\nSo PRNGs are quick and cheap. If they are designed well and started from a truly random seed, then we hope there will be know hidden patterns in the numbers, although it is difficult to be sure.\nNext time: We’ll take a closer look at pseudorandom number generation using linear congruential generators.\n\nSummary:\n\nRandom number generation has two problems: how to generate uniform random numbers between 0 and 1, and how to convert these to your desired distribution.\nUniform random numbers can be generated from true physical randomness (which will definitely be totally random, but will be slow and expensive) or using a pseudorandom number generator on a computer (which is very fast, but needs to be designed carefully to ensure a random-looking output).\nLCGs are a type of pseudorandom number generator that are started from a “seed”, which can be chosen using physical randomness or set by the user.\n\nRead more: Voss, An Introduction to Statistical Computing, introduction to Chapter 1, introduction to Section 1.1, and Subsection 1.1.3.",

    "text": "11.1 Definition and examples\nLast lecture we introduced the idea of pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs), which are deterministic functions that produce a sequence of numbers that look for all practical purposes as if they are random.\nWe introduced the idea of a recurrence, where we have a function \\(f\\) and start with a seed \\(x_1\\). We then produce a sequence through the recurrence \\(x_{i+1} = f(x_i)\\). So \\(x_2 = f(x_1)\\), \\(x_3 = f(x_2) = f(f(x_1))\\), and so on.\nWe briefly mentioned a class of such PRNGs called linear congruential generators, or LCGs. An LCG generates integers between \\(0\\) and \\(m-1\\) using a recurrence function of the form \\[ f(x) = (ax + c) \\bmod m , \\] so \\[ x_{i+1} = (ax_i + c) \\bmod m . \\]\nHere, “\\(\\mathrm{mod}\\ m\\)” means “modulo \\(m\\)”; that is, we are using modular arithmetic, where when we get to \\(m - 1\\) we wrap back to 0 and start again. (Modular arithmetic is sometimes called “clock arithmetic”, because hours of the day work modulo 12: for example, 3 hours after 11 o’clock is 2 o’clock, because \\(11 + 3 = 14 \\equiv 2 \\bmod m\\).)\nIn the LCG \\(x_{i+1} = (ax_i + c) \\bmod m\\):\nIs these examples, we’ve usually taken \\(m\\) to be a power of 2. There are a few reasons for this:",

    "text": "\\(m\\) is called the modulus,\n\\(a\\) is called the multiplier,\n\\(c\\) is called the increment,\n\\(x_1\\), the starting point, is called the seed.\n\n\nExample 11.1 Let us look at two simple LCGs with modulus \\(m = 2^4 = 16\\).\nFirst, let \\(a = 5\\) be the multiplier, \\(c = 3\\) be the increment, and \\(x_1 = 1\\) be the seed. Then we have \\[\\begin{align} x_2 &= (5x_1 + 3) \\bmod 16 = (5\\times 1 + 3) \\bmod 16 = 8 \\bmod 16 = 8 \\\\\nx_3 &= (5x_2 + 3) \\bmod 16 = (5\\times 8 + 3) \\bmod 16 = 43 \\bmod 16 = 11 \\\\\nx_4 &= (5x_3 + 3) \\bmod 16 = (5\\times 1 + 3) \\bmod 16 = 43 \\bmod 58 = 10 , \\end{align}\\] and so on. The sequence continues \\((1, 8, 11, 10, 5, 12, 15, 14, 9, 0, \\dots)\\). This looks pretty much like a random sequence of numbers between 0 and 15 to me – I certainly don’t see any obvious pattern.\nSecond, let \\(a = 3\\) be the multiplier, \\(c = 6\\) be the increment, and \\(x_1 = 1\\) be the seed. Then we have \\[\\begin{align} x_2 &= (3x_1 + 2) \\bmod 16 = (3\\times 1 + 6) \\bmod 16 = 9 \\bmod 16 = 9 \\\\\nx_3 &= (3x_2 + 4) \\bmod 16 = (3\\times 9 + 6) \\bmod 16 = 33 \\bmod 16 = 1 . \\end{align}\\] But now, using \\(x_3 = 1\\) will give \\(x_4 = 9\\) again. And \\(x_4 = 9\\) will give \\(x_5 = 1\\) again. So the sequence will be \\((1, 9, 1, 9, 1, 9, 1, \\dots)\\), with just 1 and 9 repeating for ever. This definitely doesn’t looks random!\nThe example illustrates that, while an LCG can provide a good sequence of pseudorandom numbers, we need to be careful with the parameters we choose.\n\n\nExample 11.2 Of course, it doesn’t make much sense to run LCGs by hand – the whole purpose of LCGs is that they can produce lots of (pseudo)random numbers very fast. So we should run them on computers.\nThe following R code sets up a function for sampling \\(n\\) numbers from an LCG.\n\nlcg &lt;- function(n, modulus, mult, incr, seed) {\n  samples &lt;- rep(0, n)\n  samples[1] &lt;- seed\n  for (i in 1:(n - 1)) {\n    samples[i + 1] &lt;- (mult * samples[i] + incr) %% modulus\n  }\n  return(samples)\n}\n\nIn the fourth line, %% is R’s “mod” operator.\nLet’s look at two examples with modulus \\(m = 2^8 = 256\\).\nFirst, let \\(a = 13\\) be the multiplier, \\(c = 17\\) be the increment, and \\(x_1 = 10\\) be the seed.\n\nm &lt;- 2^8\nsample1 &lt;- lcg(100, m, 13, 17, 10)\nplot(sample1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat looks like a pretty random collection of numbers to me.\nSecond, we stick with \\(a = 13\\) be the multiplier and \\(x_1 = 10\\) as the seed, be decrease the increment by 1 to \\(c = 16\\).\n\nsample2 &lt;- lcg(100, m, 13, 16, 10)\nplot(sample2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis doesn’t seem as good. We can see there’s some pattern where there are parallel downward sloping lines. And also there seems to be some sort of pattern within these downward sloping lines, sometimes with quite regularly-spaced points on those lines. And looking more closely, we can see that actually the pattern of numbers repeats exactly every 32 steps\n\nwhich(sample2 == 10)\n\n[1]  1 33 65 97\n\n\nso we only ever see 32 of the possible 256 values. This doesn’t seem to look like a sequence of independent uniformly random points.\nSo again, it seems like LCG can provide a good sequence of pseudorandom numbers, but it seems quite sensitive to a good choice of the parameters.\n\n\n\nWe will want to divide each term in the sequence \\(x_i\\) by \\(m\\) to get a number between \\([0,1]\\). If our number will be stored as a \\(b\\)-bit number, then it is makes sense to have created \\(b\\) bits (for an integer between \\(0\\) and \\(m = 2^{b} - 1\\)) in the first place. This means every integer in \\(\\{0, 1, \\dots, m-1\\}\\) corresponds to exactly one \\(b\\)-bit number. Further this makes the division by \\(m = 2^b\\) extremely simple: you simple add “0.” (zero point…) at the front of the number!\nModular arithmetic modulo a power of 2 is very simple for a computer. For a number in binary, the value modulo \\(2^b\\) is simply the last \\(b\\) bits of the number. So 10111001 modulo \\(2^4\\) is simply 1001, the last four bits.\nHaving \\(m = 2^b\\) (or, more generally, having \\(m\\) being the product of lots of small prime factors) makes it easier to choose parameters such that the LCG is a good pseudorandom number generator … as we shall see in the next section.",

    "section": "11.2 Periods of LCGs",
    "text": "11.2 Periods of LCGs\nIn an LCG, each number in the sequence depends only on the one before, since \\(x_{i+1} = (ax_i + c) \\bmod m\\). This means if we ever get a single “repeat” in our sequence – that is, if we see a number we have seen at some point before – then the whole sequence from that point on will copy what came before.\nFor example, in the second part of Example 11.1, the sequence started \\((1, 9, 1, \\dots)\\). As soon as we hit that repeat 1, we know we’re going to see that pattern \\(1, 9\\) repeated forever. We say that this LCG has “period” 2. More generally, the period of an LCG is the smallest \\(k \\geq 1\\) such that \\(x_{i+k} = x_i\\) for some \\(i\\).\nWe would like our LCGs to have a big period. If an LCG has a small period, it will not look random, as we will just repeat the same small number of values over and over again.\nThe smallest possible period is 1. That would be an extraordinarily bad LCG, as it would just spit out the same number forever. The biggest possible period is \\(m\\). That is because there are only \\(m\\) possible values in \\(\\{0, 1, \\dots, m-1\\}\\); so after \\(m+1\\) steps we must have had a repeat, by the pigeonhole principle. Having the maximum period \\(m\\) is also called having “full period”.\nGenerally, the only way to find the period of an LCG is to run it for a long time, and see how long it takes to start repeating. But, conveniently, there is a very easy way to tell if an LCG has the maximum possible period \\(m\\), thanks to a result of TE Hull and AR Dobell.\n\nTheorem 11.1 (Hull–Dobell theorem) Consider the linear congruential generator \\(x_{i+1} = (ax_i + c) \\bmod m\\). This LCG has period \\(m\\) if and only if the following three conditions hold:\n\n\\(m\\) and \\(c\\) are coprime;\n\\(a - 1\\) is divisible by all prime factors of \\(m\\);\nif \\(m\\) is divisible by 4, then \\(a - 1\\) is divisible by 4.\n\n\nIf \\(m = 2^b\\) is a power of 2 (with \\(b \\geq 2\\)), then the three conditions simplify to a particularly pleasant form:\n\n\\(c\\) is odd;\n\\(a - 1\\) is even;\n\\(a - 1\\) is divisible by 4.\n\nOf course, the third point on the list implies the second. So we only actually need to check two things:\n\n\\(c\\) is odd\n\\(a\\) is \\(1 \\bmod 4\\) (that is, \\(a\\) is one more than a multiple of 4).\n\n(We won’t prove the Hull–Dobell theorem here – it’s some pretty tricky number theory. But see Knuth, The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 2: Seminumerical algorithms, Subsubsection 3.2.1.2 if you really want a proof and have sufficient number theory background.)\n\nExample 11.3 Let’s go back to the earlier examples, and see if they have full periods or not.\nIn the first LCG of Example 11.1, we had \\(m = 2^4\\), \\(a = 5\\) and \\(c = 3\\). Here, \\(c\\) is odd, and \\(a = 4 + 1\\) is \\(1 \\bmod 4\\). This LCG fulfils both conditions, so it has the maximum possible period of 16.\nIn the second LCG of Example 11.1, we had \\(m = 2^4\\), \\(a = 3\\) and \\(c = 6\\). Here, \\(c\\) is even, and \\(a\\) is \\(2 \\bmod 4\\). This LCG does not fulfil both the conditions – in fact, it fails them both – so it does not have the maximum possible period of 16. (We already saw that it in fact has period 2.)\nIn the first LCG of Example 11.2, we had \\(m = 2^8\\), \\(a = 13\\) and \\(c = 17\\). Here, \\(c\\) is odd, and \\(a = 12 + 1\\) is \\(1 \\bmod 4\\). This LCG fulfils both conditions, so it has the maximum possible period of 256.\nIn the second LCG of Example 11.2, we had \\(m = 2^8\\), \\(a = 13\\) and \\(c = 16\\). Here, \\(c\\) is even, and \\(a = 12 + 1\\) is \\(1 \\bmod 4\\). So although this LCG does fulfil the second condition, it does not fulfil the first, so it does not have the maximum possible period of 256. (We already saw that it in fact has period 32.)\n\nIt normally a good idea to make sure your LCG has full period – if it’s so easy to ensure, then why not? (That said, a very large but not-quite-maximum period may be good enough. For example, if an LCG with modulus \\(2^{64}\\) has a period of “only” \\(2^{60}\\), that might well be enough: one million samples a second for one thousand years is only \\(2^{55}\\) samples, so you’d never actually see a repeat.)\nBut merely having full period (and a large modulus) isn’t enough by itself to guarantee an LCG will make a good pseudorandom number generator. After all, the silly LCG \\(x_{i+1} = x_i + 1\\) has full period, but the sequence \\[(0, 1, 2, 3, \\dots, m-2, m-1, 0, 1, 2, \\dots)\\] will not look random.",

    "text": "11.3 Statistical testing\nBefore being used properly, any pseudorandom number generator is subjected to a barrage of statistical tests, to check if its output seems to “look random”. Alongside checking it has a very large period, the tester will want to check other statistical properties of randomness.  Even the best PRNGs might not pass every single such test. See Voss, An Introduction to Statistical Computing, Subsection 1.1.2 for more (non-examinable) material on statistical tests for randomness.\nLCGs were considered state-of-the-art until the late-90s or so. However, it was discovered that \\(m\\) needs be very big and the number of samples used fairly small in order to pass some of the more stringent statistical tests of randomness. For example, it’s suggested that \\(n = 1\\,000\\,000\\) (one million) samples from a full-period LCG with modulus \\(m = 2^{64}\\) might be the limit before it starts “not looking random enough”. In particular, an LCG with a large period may not actually see enough repeats – after all, random numbers will have the occasional one-off repeat, just by chance. Compared to other more modern methods (like R’s default, the Mersenne Twister, mentioned in the last lecture, discovered in 1997), an LCG requires quite a lot of computation for only a modest number of samples. So while LCGs are still admired for their simplicity and elegance, they have fallen out of favour for cutting-edge computational work.\nNext time: We’ll use our pseudorandom uniform \\([0,1]\\) random numbers to make random numbers with other discrete or uniform distributions.\n\nSummary:\n\nLinear congruential generators are pseudorandom number generators based on the recurrence \\(x_{n+1} = (ax_n + c) \\bmod m\\).\nAny LCG will eventually repeat with periodic behaviour.\nSuppose \\(m\\) is a power of 2.

As suggested, we have \\[ \\theta = \\int_0^1 h(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_0^1 \\phi(x)\\,f(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\Exg \\phi(X) ,\\] where \\(X\\) is a random variable with PDF \\(f\\). To estimate this, we sample \\(X_1, \\dots, X_n\\) from \\(X\\), and use \\[ \\widehat\\theta_n^{\\mathrm{MC}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\phi(X_i) . \\]\n\n\n\n        ii.  Let \\(\\widehat\\theta_n\\) be the Monte Carlo estimate based on \\(n\\) simulations. Find the expectation and variance of \\(\\widehat\\theta_n\\), as a function of \\(n\\).\n\nSolution. As in lectures, we have \\[ \\Exg \\theta_n^{\\mathrm{MC}} = \\Ex \\left(\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\phi(X_i) \\right) = \\frac{1}{n}\\,n\\Exg\\phi(X) = \\Exg\\phi(X) \\] and \\[ \\Var\\big((\\theta_n^{\\mathrm{MC}}\\big) = \\Var \\left(\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\phi(X_i) \\right) = \\frac{1}{n^2}\\,n\\Var\\big(\\phi(X)\\big) = \\frac{1}{n}\\Var\\big(\\phi(X)\\big) . \\]\n\n\n\n        iii.  What guidelines can be given for the choice of \\(f\\) in practice?\n\nSolution. First, \\(f\\) (or equivalently \\(X\\)) should be easy to sample from. Second, we want to minimise \\(\\Var(\\phi(X))\\), so should pick \\(f\\) approximately proportional to \\(h\\), so that \\(\\phi\\) is roughly constant, and therefore has low variance.\nIn the absence of better options, \\(X\\) being uniform on \\([0, 1]\\) (so \\(f(x) = 1\\) on this interval) is often not a bad choice.\n\n\n\n\n(b)  Consider evaluation the integral \\[ \\int_0^1 x^2\\,\\mathrm{d}x \\] by Monte Carlo integration using \\(f(x) = \\Ind_{[0,1]}(x)\\). Write down the Monte Carlo estimator \\(\\widehat\\theta_n\\).\n\nSolution. Since \\(f(x) = 1\\) on this interval, we must take \\(\\phi(x) = x^2\\). Thus the estimator is \\[\\widehat\\theta_n = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 ,\\] where \\(X_i \\sim \\operatorname{U}[0,1]\\) are independent.\n\n          Explain how antithetic variables can be used in this situation, and justify briefly why their use here is guaranteed to improve efficiency.\n\nSolution. Antithetic variables attempt to reduce the variance in Monte Carlo estimation by using pairs of variables \\((X_i, X'_i)\\) that both have the same distribution as \\(X\\), but where \\(\\phi(X)\\) and \\(\\phi(X')\\) are negatively correlated.\nIn this situation, if \\(X_i \\sim \\operatorname{U}[0,1]\\), then \\(X'_i = 1 - X_i\\) has this same distribution. The corresponding antithetic variable estimator is \\[\\widehat\\theta_n^{\\mathrm{AV}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n/2} \\big(X_i^2 + (1 - X_i)^2\\big) .\\]\nAn anitithetic variables estimator always decreases the variance of a Monte Carlo estimator if the correlation (or, equivalently, the covariance) between \\(\\phi(X)\\) and \\(\\phi(X')\\) is negative. We saw in lectures that, if \\(X \\sim \\operatorname{U}[0,1]\\) and \\(\\phi\\) is monotonically increasing, then \\(\\phi(X)\\) and \\(\\phi(1 - X)\\) have negative correlation. Since \\(x^2\\) is increasing on \\([0,1]\\), that is the case here.\n\n          For \\(U \\sim \\operatorname{U}[0,1]\\), use the results \\[\\Ex U^2 = \\tfrac13 \\qquad \\Ex U^4 = \\tfrac15 \\qquad \\Ex U^2(1-U)^2 = \\tfrac{1}{30} \\] to find the correlation between \\(U^2\\) and \\((1-U)^2\\). Hence, or otherwise, confirm that using antithetic variables reduces the variance of the Monte Carlo estimator by a factor of 8.\n\nSolution. We need to find the correlation between \\(U^2\\) and \\((1 - U)^2\\), where \\(U \\sim \\operatorname{U}[0,1]\\). The covariance is \\[ \\operatorname{Cov}\\big(U^2, (1-U)^2\\big)\n= \\Ex U^2(1-U)^2 - \\big(\\Ex U^2\\big) \\big(\\Ex (1-U)^2\\big)\n= \\tfrac{1}{30} - \\Big(\\tfrac{1}{3}\\Big)^2 = -\\tfrac{7}{90} .\\] The variance are both \\[ \\Var(U^2) = \\Ex U^4 - \\big(\\Ex U^2\\big)^2 = \\tfrac15 - \\Big(\\tfrac{1}{3}\\Big)^2 = \\tfrac{4}{45} . \\] Hence, the correlation is \\[ \\rho = \\operatorname{Corr}\\big(U^2, (1-U)^2\\big) = \\frac{-\\frac{7}{90}}{\\frac{4}{45}} = -\\tfrac78 . \\]\nThe variance of the standard Monte Carlo estimator is \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\Var(\\phi(X))\\), while the variance of the antithetic variables estimator is \\(\\frac{1+\\rho}{n}\\Var(\\phi(X))\\). So the variance changes by a factor of \\(1 + \\rho\\), which here is \\(1 - \\frac{7}{8} = \\frac{1}{8}\\). So the variance reduces by a factor of 8, as claimed.\n\n          (You may use without proof any results about the variance of antithetic variable estimates, but you should clearly state any results you are using.)\n\n\n\n2.     Let \\(X \\sim \\operatorname{N}(0,1)\\). Consider importance sampling estimation for the probability \\(\\theta = \\mathbb P(3 \\leq X \\leq 4)\\) using samples \\(Y_i\\) from the following sample distributions: (i) \\(Y \\sim \\operatorname{N}(1,1)\\); (ii) \\(Y \\sim \\operatorname{N}(2,1)\\); (iii) \\(Y \\sim \\operatorname{N}(3.5,1)\\); (iv) \\(Y \\sim 3 + \\operatorname{Exp}(1)\\).\nEach of these four distributions gives rise to a different importance sampling method. Our aim is to compare the resulting estimates.\n\n(a)  For each of the four methods, estimate the variance \\(\\Var\\big(\\frac{f(Y)}{g(Y)}\\,\\phi(Y)\\big)\\). Which of these four methods gives the best results?\n\nSolution.

The basic Monte Carlo estimator is \\[ \\widehat\\theta_n^{\\mathrm{MC}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n\\phi(X_i) , \\] where the \\(X_i\\) are independent random samples from \\(X\\).\nThe basic importance sampling estimator is \\[ \\widehat\\theta_n^{\\mathrm{IS}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{f(Y_i)}{g(Y_i)} \\,\\phi(Y_i) , \\] where the \\(Y_i\\) are independent random samples from a random variable \\(Y\\) with probability density function \\(g\\). We must have \\(g(y) &gt; 0\\) whenever \\(f(y) &gt; 0\\).\nThe main advantage of the importance sampling estimator is that can reduce the variance of the estimator by oversampling the most important areas of \\(y\\), but then downweighting those samples. Another advantage is that importance sampling can be used when it is difficult to sample from \\(X\\).\n\n\n\n(b)  Prove that both the basic Monte Carlo and importance sampling estimates from part (a) are unbiased.\n\nSolution. For the standard Monte Carlo estimator, \\[ \\Exg \\theta_n^{\\mathrm{MC}} = \\Ex \\left(\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\phi(X_i) \\right) = \\frac{1}{n}\\,n\\Exg\\phi(X) = \\Exg\\phi(X) = \\theta .\\]\nFor the importance sampling estimator, first note that \\[ \\mathbb E \\left(\\frac{f(Y)}{g(Y)}\\,\\phi(Y)\\right) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\frac{f(y)}{g(y)}\\,\\phi(y)\\,g(y)\\,\\mathrm{d}y = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\phi(y) \\,f(y) \\, \\mathrm{d}y = \\Exg\\phi(X)  , \\] since \\(f\\) is the PDF of \\(X\\). Hence \\[ \\Exg \\widehat\\theta_n^{\\mathrm{IS}} = \\Exg \\left(\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{f(Y_i)}{g(Y_i)} \\,\\phi(Y_i) \\right) = \\frac{1}{n}\\,n\\,\\Ex \\left(\\frac{f(Y)}{g(Y)}\\,\\phi(Y)\\right) = \\Exg \\phi(X) = \\theta. \\]\nHence, both estimators are unbiased.\n\n\n\n(c)  Show that the variance of the importance sampling estimator is given by \\[ \\Var\\big(\\widehat\\theta_n^{\\mathrm{IS}}\\big) = \\frac{1}{n}\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\frac{f(y)^2 \\phi(y)^2}{g(y)}\\,\\mathrm{d}y - \\frac{1}{n}\\big(\\Exg \\phi(X)\\big)^2. \\]\n\nSolution. First, note that \\[\\begin{align} \\Var \\left(\\frac{f(Y)}{g(Y)}\\,\\phi(Y)\\right)\n&= \\Ex \\left(\\frac{f(Y)}{g(Y)}\\,\\phi(Y)\\right)^2 - \\big(\\Exg \\phi(X)\\big)^2 \\\\\n&= \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\left(\\frac{f(y)}{g(y)}\\,\\phi(y)\\right)^2 g(y)\\,\\mathrm{d}y  - \\big(\\Exg \\phi(X)\\big)^2\\\\\n&= \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\frac{f(y)^2}{g(y)^2}\\,\\phi(y)^2 \\,g(y)\\,\\mathrm{d}y  - \\big(\\Exg \\phi(X)\\big)^2\\\\\n&= \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\frac{f(y)^2}{g(y)}\\,\\phi(y)^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}y  - \\big(\\Exg \\phi(X)\\big)^2 \\end{align} \\] Second, we have \\[ \\Var\\big(\\widehat\\theta_n^{\\mathrm{IS}}\\big) = \\Var \\left(\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{f(Y_i)}{g(Y_i)} \\,\\phi(Y_i) \\right) = \\frac{1}{n} \\Var \\left(\\frac{f(Y)}{g(Y)}\\,\\phi(Y)\\right) . \\] Putting these together proves the result.\n\n\n\n(d)  Let \\(X \\sim \\operatorname{N}(0,2)\\) and \\(a \\in \\mathbb R\\). We want to estimate \\(\\theta = \\Ex \\big(\\sqrt{2}\\exp(-(X-a)^2/4)\\big)\\), using importance sampling with samples \\(Y \\sim \\operatorname{N}(\\mu, 1)\\) for some \\(\\mu \\in \\mathbb R\\). Using the result from part (c), or otherwise, show that in the case the variance of the importance sampling estimator \\(\\widehat\\theta_n^{\\mathrm{IS}}\\) is given by \\[ \\Var\\big(\\widehat\\theta_n^{\\mathrm{IS}}\\big) = \\frac{\\exp(\\mu^2 - a\\mu) - \\theta^2}{n} . \\]\n\nSolution. It’s clear, using part (c), that it will suffice to show that \\[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\frac{f(y)^2 \\phi(y)^2}{g(y)}\\,\\mathrm{d}y = \\exp(\\mu^2 - a\\mu) . \\] Here, we have \\[ \\begin{align}\nf(y) &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi}} \\exp\\big(-\\tfrac14 y^2 \\big) \\\\\ng(y) &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\big(-\\tfrac12 (y-\\mu)^2 \\big) \\\\\n\\phi(y) &= \\sqrt{2} \\exp\\big(-\\tfrac14 (y-a)^2 \\big) .\n\\end{align} \\] Therefore, by a long and painful algebra slog, we have \\[ \\begin{align}\n\\frac{f(y)^2 \\phi(y)^2}{g(y)} &= \\frac{\\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\exp\\big(-\\tfrac12 y^2 \\big)\\times 2\\exp\\big(-\\tfrac12 (y-a)^2 \\big)}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\big(-\\tfrac12 (y-\\mu)^2 \\big)} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp \\Big(-\\tfrac12 \\big(y^2 + (y-a)^2 - (y-\\mu)^2 \\big)\\Big) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp \\Big(-\\tfrac12 \\big(y^2 - 2(a - \\mu)y + a^2 + \\mu^2\\big)\\Big) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp \\Big(-\\tfrac12 \\big((y - (a - \\mu))^2 - (a- \\mu)^2 + a^2 - \\mu^2\\big)\\Big) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp \\Big(-\\tfrac12 \\big((y - (a - \\mu))^2 + 2a\\mu - 2\\mu^2 \\big)\\Big) \\\\\n&=  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp \\Big(-\\tfrac12 \\big(y - (a - \\mu)\\big)^2\\Big)\\exp(\\mu^2 + a\\mu),\n\\end{align} \\] where we ‘completed the square’ on the fourth line. Thus \\[ \\begin{align}\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\frac{f(y)^2 \\phi(y)^2}{g(y)}\\,\\mathrm{d}y\n&= \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp \\Big(-\\tfrac12 \\big(y - (a - \\mu)\\big)^2\\Big)\\exp(\\mu^2 + 2a) \\,\\mathrm{d}y\\\\\n&= \\exp(\\mu^2 + 2a) \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp \\Big(-\\tfrac12 \\big(y - (a - \\mu)\\big)^2\\Big)\\,\\mathrm{d}y \\\\\n&= \\exp(\\mu^2 - a\\mu) ,\n\\end{align} \\] since the big integral on the right is the integral of the PDF of a normal \\(\\operatorname{N}(a-\\mu, 1)\\) distribution, so equals 1.\nHence, we have proved the result.\n\n          For fixed \\(n\\) and \\(a\\), find the value of \\(\\mu\\) for which the importance sampling estimator has the smallest mean-square error. Comment on the result.\n\nSolution. Minimising this expression is equivalent to minimising \\(\\mu^2 + a\\mu\\). By differentiating with respect to \\(\\mu\\) (or otherwise), we see that this is at \\(a = 2 \\mu\\) or \\(\\mu = \\frac12 a\\).\n\n\n\n\n4.     (Answer the following question “by hand”, without using R.

    "text": "12.1 Uniform random variables\nWe’ve seen how to generate uniform random variates \\(U \\sim \\operatorname{U}[0,1]\\), either using true physical randomness or the output of a pseudorandom number generator. But in statistics – whether performing Monte Carlo estimation or anything else – we typically want to sample from some other distribution \\(X\\).\nIn the next five lectures, we will look at ways we can transform the uniform random variable \\(U\\) to take on different distributions instead. We start today by looking at some important special cases.\nWe know how to generate \\(U \\sim \\operatorname{U}[0,1]\\). But suppose we want to generate \\(X \\sim \\operatorname{U}[a,b]\\) instead, for some \\(a &lt; b\\); how can we do that.\nWell, the original \\(U\\) has “width” 1, and we want \\(X\\) to have width \\(b - a\\), so the first thing we should do is multiply by \\((b-a)\\). This gives us \\((b-a)U\\), which we expect should be uniform on \\([0,b-a]\\). Then we need to shift it, so it starts not a \\(0\\) but at \\(a\\); we can do this by adding \\(a\\). This gives us \\((b-a)U + a\\), which should be uniform on \\([0 + a, (b-a) + a] = [a, b]\\). So \\(X = (b-a)U + a\\) would seem to give us the desired \\(X \\sim \\operatorname{U}[a,b]\\) random variable.\nWe can check this seems to have worked by using a histogram, for example.\nBut what if we very formally wanted to prove that \\(X = (b-a)U + a\\) definitely has the distribution \\(X \\sim \\operatorname{U}[a,b]\\); how could we do that?\nThe best way to give a formal proof of something like this is to use the cumulative distribution function (CDF). Recall that the CDF \\(F_Y\\) of a distribution \\(Y\\) is the function \\(F_Y(y) = \\mathbb P(Y \\leq y)\\). One benefit of the CDF is it works equally well for both discrete and continuous random variables, so we don’t need to give separate arguments for discrete and continuous cases.\nThe CDF of the standard uniform distribution \\(U \\sim \\operatorname{U}[0,1]\\) is \\[ F_U(u) = \\begin{cases} 0 & u &lt; 0 \\\\ u & 0 \\leq u \\leq 1 \\\\ 1 & u &gt; 1 , \\end{cases}  \\tag{12.1}\\] and the CDF of any uniform distribution \\(X \\sim \\operatorname{U}[a,b]\\) is \\[ F_X(x) = \\begin{cases} 0 & x &lt; a \\\\ \\displaystyle\\frac{x - a}{b-a} & a \\leq x \\leq b \\\\ 1 & x &gt; b . \\end{cases}  \\tag{12.2}\\] So to show that \\(X = (b-a)U + a \\sim \\operatorname{U}[a,b]\\), we take the fact that \\(U\\) has the CDF in Equation 12.1 and try to use it to show that \\(X\\) has the CDF in Equation 12.2.\nIndeed, we have \\[ F_X(x) = \\mathbb P(X \\leq x) = \\mathbb P\\big((b-a)U + a \\leq x\\big) = \\mathbb P \\left( U \\leq \\frac{x - a}{b-a}\\right) . \\] But putting \\(u = (x - a)/(b - a)\\) in Equation 12.1, does indeed give the CDF in Equation 12.2. The lower boundary \\(u &lt; 0\\) becomes \\(x &lt; 0 \\times (b-a) + a = a\\); the upper boundary \\(u &gt; b\\) becomes \\(x &gt; 1 \\times(b-a) + a = b\\); and, in between, the CDF \\(u\\) becomes \\((x - a)/(b - a)\\). Thus we have proven that \\(X\\) has the CDF of the \\(\\operatorname{U}[a,b]\\) distribution, as required.",

    "text": "12.2 Discrete random variables\nSuppose we want to simulate a Bernoulli trial; that is, a random variable \\(X\\) that is 1 with probability \\(p\\) and 0 with probability \\(1 - p\\), for some \\(p\\) with \\(0 &lt; p &lt; 1\\). As ever, we only have a standard uniform \\(U \\sim \\operatorname{U}[0,1]\\) to work with. How can we form our Bernoulli trial?\nHere are two possible ways:\n\nIf \\(U &lt; p\\), then take \\(X = 1\\); while if \\(U \\geq p\\), take \\(X = 0\\). Note that \\(\\mathbb P(X = 1) = \\mathbb P(U &lt; p) = p\\) and \\(\\mathbb P(X = 0) = \\mathbb P(U \\geq p) = 1 - \\mathbb P(U &lt; p) = 1 - p\\), as required.\nAlternatively: if \\(U \\leq 1 -p\\), take \\(X' = 0\\); while if \\(U &gt; p\\), take \\(X' = 1\\).\n\nThe first method is just the second method with \\(U\\) replaced by \\(1 - U\\). Interestingly, that means we can generate two different Bernoulli trials \\(X\\) and \\(X'\\) from the same \\(U\\), which will therefore be negatively correlated. Although there’s unlikely to be any situation where a Bernoulli trial would be used in Monte Carlo estimation, in theory, the two versions \\((X, X')\\) generated from the same \\(U\\) could potentially be used as antithetic variables.\nWhat about more general discrete random variables? Suppose a random variable takes values \\(x_1, x_2, \\dots\\) with probabilities \\(p_1, p_2, \\dots\\). We can think of these probabilities as splitting up the interval \\([0,1]\\) into subintervals of lengths \\(p_1, p_2, \\dots\\), since these probabilities add up to 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo the first interval is \\(I_1 = (0, p_1]\\); the second interval is \\((p_1, p_1 + p_2]\\); the third intervals is \\((p_1 + p_2, p_1 + p_2 + p_3]\\), and so on. We then pick a point \\(U\\) from \\([0,1]\\) uniformly at random, and whichever interval \\(I_i\\) it is in, take the corresponding value \\(x_i\\).\nIn terms of the CDF, we have \\(F_X(x_i) = p_1 + p_2 + \\cdots + p_i\\), so the intervals are of the form \\((F_X(x_{i-1}), F_X(x_i)]\\). So we can think of this as rounding \\(F_X(U)\\) up to the next \\(F_X(x_i)\\), then taking that value \\(x_i\\).\n\nExample 12.2 Consider generating a binomial distribution \\(X \\sim \\operatorname{Bin}(5, \\frac12)\\).

We see that \\(u_1\\) is bigger that \\(F_X(2) = 0.5\\) (the upper end of the “2” interval) but less than \\(F_X(3) = 0.8125\\) (the upper end of the “3” interval), so falls into the “3” interval. So our first binomial variate is \\(x_1 = 3\\).\nIf we then got the next uniform variate \\(u_2 = 0.4353\\), we would see that \\(u_2\\) is between \\(F_X(1) = 0.1875\\) and \\(F_X(2) = 0.5\\), so would take \\(x_2 = 2\\) for our next binomial variate.\n\nNext time: Sampling from continuous distribution using the CDF.\n\nSummary:\n\nIf \\(U \\sim \\operatorname{U}[0,1]\\), then \\(X = (b-a)U + a \\sim \\operatorname{U}[a,b]\\).\nA discrete random variable can be generated by splitting \\([0,1]\\) into subintervals with lengths according to the probabilities, then picking a point from the interval at random.\n\nRemember that your answers to Problem Sheet 2 will be discussed in the problems class on Thursday 31 October.\nRead more: Voss, An Introduction to Statistical Computing, Sections 1.2 and 1.3.",

Booth involved the cumulative distribution function \\(F(x) = \\mathbb P(X \\leq x)\\).

For the first obstacle, if there are many points \\(x\\) with \\(F(x) = u\\), we take the first one – that is, the smallest \\(x\\) with \\(F(x) = u\\).

    "text": "13.2 Inverse transform\nThe inverse transform method works like this: To generate \\(X\\), simply apply the inverse CDF \\(F^{-1}\\) to a standard uniform random variable \\(U\\).\n\nTheorem 13.1 Let \\(F\\) be a cumulative distribution function, and let \\(F^{-1}\\) be its inverse. Let \\(U \\sim \\operatorname{U}[0,1]\\). Then \\(X = F^{-1}(U)\\) has cumulative distribution function \\(F\\).\n\n\nProof. We need to show that \\(\\mathbb P(X \\leq x) = F(x)\\) when this is in \\((0,1)\\). The proof is very easy if \\(F\\) has no “gaps” or “jumps” as described above. Then, we simply have \\[ \\mathbb P(X \\leq x) = \\mathbb P\\big(F^{-1}(U) \\leq x\\big) = \\mathbb P\\big(U \\leq F(x)\\big) = F(x), \\] where we have simply “undone” the function \\(F^{-1}\\) and used that \\(\\mathbb P(U \\leq u) = u\\) for \\(u \\in (0,1)\\).\nFor the general case, we need to be just a little bit more careful. We have \\[ \\mathbb P(X \\leq x) = \\mathbb P\\big(F^{-1}(U) \\leq x\\big) = \\mathbb P\\big(\\min\\{y : F(y) \\geq U \\} \\leq x \\big) .\\] If \\(x\\) is bigger than the minimum \\(y\\) with \\(F(y) \\geq u\\), then certainly \\(F(x) \\geq u\\) as well; while if \\(F(x) \\geq u\\), then \\(x\\) must be at least as big as the minimum \\(y\\) for which \\(F(y) \\geq u\\). Hence \\(\\min\\{y : F(y) \\geq U \\} \\leq x\\) if and only if \\(F(x) \\geq U\\).

In particular, the inverse CDF of the normal distribution does not have a closed form, so this does not give a way of sampling normal distributions. Later we’ll see other methods that allow us to sample from normal random variables.",

    "text": "13.4 Box–Muller transform\n[This was actually lectured at the beginning of Lecture 14, but belongs in this section.]\nWhile the inverse transform method is very powerful, we have mentioned that it doesn’t work directly for the normal distribution, which does not have an exact closed form for the inverse CDF. (Although R does actually use the inverse transform method in its rnorm() function by using an approximation to the inverse CDF.)\nInstead, the Box–Muller transform (discovered by the statistician GEP Box and the computer scientist Marvin E Muller in 1958) is a clever way to easily transform a standard uniform into a normal distribution.\nActually, that’s not quite true. Rather than transforming one standard uniform \\(U\\) into one normal distribution \\(X\\), it instead transforms two independent standard uniforms \\(U, V\\) into two normal distributions \\(X, Y\\). (There is some profound mathematical sense in which the two-dimensional bivariate normal is somehow a more “deeply” important mathematical object than the one-dimensional univariate normal we are used to, but we don’t have time to get into that here.)\nFirst, let’s note it suffices to produce a standard normal \\(X \\sim \\operatorname{N}(0,1)\\). Any other normal distribution \\(W \\sim \\operatorname{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) can then be formed as \\(W = \\sigma X + \\mu\\).\nThe idea of the Box–Muller transform is based on converting the two standard normal distributions \\((X, Y)\\) from cartesian coordinates into polar coordinates \\((R, \\Theta)\\). (Those of you who have know how to calculate the Gaussian integral will have seen this idea before.)\n[picture]\n\nTheorem 13.2 Let \\(X, Y \\sim \\operatorname{N}(0,1)\\) be independent standard normal distributions. Write \\[ R = \\sqrt{X^2 + Y^2} \\qquad\\qquad \\Theta = \\tan \\frac{Y}{X} \\] for the radius and the angle of \\((X, Y)\\) in polar coordinates. Then the radius \\(R\\) has a Rayleigh distribution with scalar parameter \\(\\gamma = 1\\), the angle \\(\\Theta\\) has a uniform distribution on \\([0, 2\\pi]\\), and \\(R\\) and \\(\\Theta\\) are independent.\n\n\nProof. The joint PDF of \\((X,Y)\\) is \\[\\begin{align}\nf_{X,Y}(x, y) \\,\\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}y &= f_X(x) \\,f_Y(y) \\,\\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}y \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\, \\exp \\big(-\\tfrac12 x^2\\big) \\, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\,\\exp \\big(-\\tfrac12 y^2\\big) \\,\\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}y \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\,\\exp \\big(-\\tfrac12 (x^2 + y^2)\\big) \\,\\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}y .  \n\\end{align}\\] {#eq-box-1} The joint PDF of \\((R, \\Theta)\\) is \\[\\begin{align}\nf_{R, \\Theta}(r, \\theta) \\,\\mathrm{d}r\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta &= f_R(r) \\,f_\\Theta(\\theta) \\,\\mathrm{d}r\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta \\\\\n&= r\\exp \\big(-\\tfrac12 r^2\\big) \\, \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\, \\mathrm{d}r\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta ,\n\\end{align}\\] {#eq-box-2}\nBut in ?eq-box-1, we can substitute \\(r = x^2 + y^2\\) and \\(\\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}y = r\\,\\mathrm{d}r\\,\\mathrm{d}\\theta\\), and get ?eq-box-2.\n\nSo we’ve reduced the problem of sample two normal distributions to sampling a Rayleigh (with scale parameter 1) and a uniform (on \\([0, 2\\pi]\\)). But we know how to do this. We saw in Example 13.2 that we can take \\(R = \\sqrt{-2 \\log U}\\) (or \\(\\sqrt{-2 \\log(1-U)}\\)), and we saw in the last lecture that we can take \\(\\Theta = 2\\pi V\\). We can then transform back into cartesian coordinates with \\[\\begin{align}\nX &= R\\cos \\Theta =  \\sqrt{-2 \\log U} \\cos(2\\pi V) \\\\\nY &= R\\sin \\Theta =  \\sqrt{-2 \\log U} \\sin(2\\pi V) .\n\\end{align}\\]\n\nn &lt;- 1e5\nunif1 &lt;- runif(n)\nunif2 &lt;- runif(n)\nrad &lt;- sqrt(-2 * log(unif1))\nang &lt;- 2 * pi * unif2\nsamples &lt;- c(rad * cos(ang), rad * sin(ang))\n\nhist(samples, probability = TRUE, breaks = 50, xlim = c(-4, 4))\ncurve(dnorm(x), add = TRUE, col = \"blue\", lwd = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis confirms that we get an excellent match to the normal distribution.\nNext time: Sampling using rejection.\n\nSummary:\n\nThe inverse \\(F^{-1}\\) of a CDF \\(F\\) is defined by \\(F^{-1}_X(u) = \\min \\big \\{x : F_X(x) \\geq u \\big\\}\\).\nThe inverse transform method converts \\(U \\sim \\operatorname{U}[0,1]\\) to a random variable with CDF by setting \\(X = F^{-1}(U)\\). That is: Set \\(U = F(X)\\), and rearrange to make \\(X\\) the subject.\nThe Box–Muller transform is a way to generate two independent standard normal distributions. Set \\(R\\) to Rayleigh with scale parameter 1, set \\(\\Theta \\sim \\operatorname{U}[0,2\\pi]\\), then take \\(X = R \\cos \\Theta\\) and \\(Y = R \\sin \\Theta\\).\n\nRead more: Voss, An Introduction to Statistical Computing, Section 1.3.",

    "text": "14.1 Rejection\nIn the last two lectures, we have taken standard uniform \\(U \\sim \\operatorname{U}[0,1]\\) random variables, and have applied a function to them to transform into some other distribution \\(X\\). One \\(U\\) gets turned into one \\(X\\). (Or, for the Box–Muller transform, two \\(U\\)s become two \\(X\\)s.)\nBut so far, we have taken each sample we are given. But another way to get a different distribution is to throw out samples we don’t like and wait until we get a sample we do like. This is called rejection sampling.\nSuppose we want not a \\(\\operatorname{U}[0,1]\\) random variable but instead a \\(\\operatorname{U}[0,\\tfrac12]\\) random variable. One way we’ve already seen to do this is by the inverse transform method: simply multiply \\(U\\) by \\(\\tfrac12\\). But we could also do this by rejection. We start with a proposed sample \\(U \\sim \\operatorname{U}[0,1]\\). If \\(U \\leq \\tfrac12\\), we “accept” the sample, and keep it. But if \\(U &gt; \\tfrac12\\), we “reject” the samples – we throw it away and ask for a new one. We keep proposing samples until we accept one that’s less than \\(\\tfrac12\\). It should be easy to convince yourself that we get a \\(\\operatorname{U}[0,\\tfrac12]\\) random variable this way. (But we’ll prove it later, if not.)\nThe advantage of rejection sampling is that it can help us get samples from some distributions that we couldn’t access with the inverse transform method. The disadvantage is that it can be costly or slow, because we may have to reject lots of samples before finding enough that we can accept. The more often we reject samples, the slower the procedure will be.\nRejection sampling is particularly useful for sampling from a conditional distribution, such as the conditional distribution of \\(Y\\) given that \\(Y \\in A\\): we simply accept a sample \\(y\\) if \\(y \\in A\\) and reject it if not.",

First, we could decide to take \\(n\\) proposal samples from \\(Y\\) and just see how many get accepted.\n\nn_prop &lt;- 1e6\nprops   &lt;- rnorm(n_prop)\naccepts &lt;- props[props &gt;= 1]\nlength(accepts)\n\n[1] 158692\n\nMCest1 &lt;- mean(accepts)\nMCest1\n\n[1] 1.525705\n\n\nWe end up accepting around 160,000 samples out of the 1,000,000 proposals we had to start with.\nSecond, we could keep proposing as many samples as needed until we reach some desired number of acceptances.\n\nn_acc &lt;- 1e5\n\nsamples &lt;- rep(0, n_acc)\ncount &lt;- 0\nfor (i in 1:n_acc) {\n  newsample &lt;- 0\n  while (newsample &lt; 1) {\n    newsample &lt;- rnorm(1)\n    count &lt;- count + 1\n  }\n  samples[i] &lt;- newsample\n}\ncount\n\n[1] 628133\n\nMCest2 &lt;- mean(samples)\nMCest2\n\n[1] 1.526865\n\n\nThis required taking about 630,000 proposals to get 100,000 acceptances.\nHere we used a “while” loop to keep taking samples until we go one that was not less than 1.

    "text": "14.2 Acceptance probability\nSo far, we have looked at always accepting or always rejecting a proposed sample, depending on its value. But we could “perhaps” accept some proposals too. Suppose we are already sampling from some distribution \\(Y\\) (perhaps generated via the inverse transform method, for example). If we see the proposed sample \\(Y = x\\), we could accept it with some acceptance probability \\(\\alpha(x) \\in [0,1]\\). We can control the accepted samples more delicately by adjusting this acceptance function \\(\\alpha\\) to values that aren’t just 0 or 1.\nWhat is the distribution of an accepted sample \\(X\\)?\nWell, using Bayes’ theorem, we have in the discrete case \\[\\mathbb P(X = x) = \\mathbb P(Y = x \\mid \\text{accept}) = \\frac{\\mathbb P(Y = x)\\,\\mathbb P(\\text{accept} \\mid Y = x)}{\\mathbb P(\\text{accept})} = \\frac{1}{Z} \\alpha(x)\\,\\mathbb P(Y = x) .\\] where \\(Z = \\mathbb P(\\text{accept})\\) is the normalising constant. In the continuous case, with \\(g\\) the PDF of the original \\(Y\\) and \\(f\\) the PDF of the accepted \\(X\\), we have \\[ f(x) = g(x \\mid \\text{accept}) = \\frac{g(x)\\,\\mathbb P(\\text{accept} \\mid X = x)}{\\mathbb P(\\text{accept})} = \\frac{1}{Z}\\,\\alpha(x)\\,g(x) , \\] where \\(Z = \\mathbb P(\\text{accept})\\) again.\n\nExample 14.2 Suppose we wish to sample from the distribution \\[ f(x) \\propto \\exp\\big(-\\tfrac12x^2\\big)\\,(\\sin^2 x) . \\tag{14.1}\\] How can we do this?\nWell, we can note that the PDF of the standard normal is \\[ g(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\,\\exp\\big(-\\tfrac12x^2\\big) \\propto \\exp\\big(-\\tfrac12x^2\\big) \\] and that \\[ 0 \\leq \\sin^2x\\leq 1 .\\] (Here, \\(\\sin^2 x\\) means \\((\\sin x)^2\\), by the way.) This means that, if we take proposals \\(Y \\sim \\operatorname{N}(0,1)\\), and then accept an proposed sample with probability \\(\\alpha(x) = \\sin^2 x\\), that will give us the distribution Equation 14.1.\n\nn_prop &lt;- 1e6\nprops &lt;- rnorm(n_prop)\naccepts &lt;- props[runif(n_prop) &lt;= sin(props)^2]\nlength(accepts)\n\n[1] 431663\n\nhist(accepts, probability = TRUE, breaks = 50)\ncurve(\n  0.92 * exp(-x^2 / 2) * sin(x)^2, add = TRUE, n = 1001,\n  lwd = 2, col = \"blue\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy rejecting lots of proposals with values near 0, we turned the unimodal (“one hump”)proposal distribution \\(Y \\sim \\operatorname{N}(0,1)\\) into this interesting bimodal (“two hump”) distribution.\nLet’s explain line 3 more carefully. We want to accept a proposal \\(x\\) with probability \\(\\sin^2 x\\). We saw in Lecture 12 that we can simulate a Bernoulli\\((p)\\) distribution by taking the value 1 is \\(U \\leq p\\) and taking 0 if \\(U &gt; p\\). So in line 3, we are accepting each proposed sample \\(x_i\\) if a standard uniform variate \\(u_i\\) satisfies \\(u_i \\leq \\sin^2 x_i\\).\nIn this example, we found we accepted about 430,000 samples.\n\nIn this example, we managed to sample from the PDF in Equation 14.1, \\[ f(x) = \\frac{1}{Z}\\,\\exp\\big(-\\tfrac12x^2\\big)\\,(\\sin^2 x) ,\\] even though we never found out what the normalising constant \\(Z\\) was. This idea – that we can sample from a distribution even if we only know it up to a multiplicative constant – is a very important one that will come up a lot later in this module.\nWe won’t go into that idea deeply now, but we briefly mention that it is very important in Bayesian statistics. In Bayesian statistics, the posterior distribution is often known only up to proportionality. That’s because we have \\[\\begin{align}\n\\text{posterior} &\\propto \\text{prior}\\times\\text{likelihood} \\\\\n\\pi(\\theta \\mid x) &\\propto\\, \\pi(x) \\times p(x \\mid \\theta)\n\\end{align}\\] It’s often very difficult to find the normalising constant in this expression – indeed, it can be impossible in practice. So being able to sample from such a posterior distribution without finding the constant is very important for Bayesian statisticians.",

    "text": "14.3 How many samples?\nWe have mentioned that the downside of rejection sampling is that we may have to take lots of proposed samples to get enough accepted ones. Or, conversely, we may not get enough accepted samples from a fixed number of proposed samples. Remember that the accuracy of Monte Carlo estimation, for example, depends on how many (accepted) samples we get – the mean-square error scales like \\(1/n\\) and the root-mean-square error like \\(1/\\sqrt{n}\\). So it’s important to be able to get a lot of accepted samples \\(n\\).\nLet’s examine these questions a bit closer. Write \\(a = \\mathbb P(\\text{accept})\\) for the unconditional probability a proposal gets accepted (that is, the a priori acceptance probability, before we have seen the value \\(Y = x\\) of the proposal). In the discrete case, this is \\[ a = \\mathbb P(\\text{accept}) = \\sum_x \\mathbb P(Y = x)\\,\\alpha(x) , \\] and in the continuous case this is \\[ a  = \\mathbb P(\\text{accept}) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} g(x)\\,\\alpha(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x . \\] In both cases, this can be written more succinctly as \\(a = \\Exg\\alpha(Y)\\).\n\nIf we take \\(N\\) proposals, then the expected number of accepted samples is \\(n = aN\\).\nIf we keep taking proposals until getting \\(n\\) acceptances, then the expected number of proposals is \\(N = n/a\\).\n\nIf the number of proposals \\(N\\) is large and the unconditional acceptance probability \\(a\\) is not very close to 0, then the actual number of acceptances will likely be very close to \\(aN\\). This is justified by the law of large numbers (and the central limit theorem). Similarly, if the desired number of acceptances \\(n\\) is large and \\(a\\) is not very close to 0, then the number of required proposals will likely be very close to \\(n/a\\). Thus it is in our interest to make \\(a\\) as large as we can: this gives us the most acceptances, or requires the fewest proposals.\nWe have to be careful when the unconditional acceptance probability is very close to \\(0\\). In that case, there can be a lot of variability required in either the (very small) number of accepted samples or the (very large) number of required proposals. This unpredictability is another reason to avoid rejection sampling where the unconditional acceptance probability \\(a\\) is very small.\n\nNext time. We look closer at rejection sampling, and in particular how we can target rejection sampling at a given distribution using the “envelope” method.\n\nSummary:\n\nIn rejection sampling, we accept a proposed sample \\(Y = x\\) with probability \\(\\alpha(x)\\).\nIf the PDF of a proposed sample is \\(g\\), then the PDF of an accepted sample is proportional to \\(\\alpha(x) \\,g(x)\\).\nWhen the acceptance probability is low, rejection sampling can require a lot of proposed samples to get enough accepted samples.\n\nRead more: Voss, An Introduction to Statistical Computing, Subsections 1.4.1 and 1.4.3.",

    "text": "15.1 Sampling under the curve\nLast time, we started looking at rejection sampling. We found that if you start with a proposal distribution \\(Y\\) with PDF \\(g\\), then accept a proposal \\(Y = x\\) with probability \\(\\alpha(x)\\), then the PDF \\(f\\) of a sample conditional on acceptance satisfies \\(f(x) \\propto \\alpha(x) g(x)\\).\nThe problem is that this sort of gets the problem backwards. If we pick a proposal distribution \\(g\\) and acceptance function \\(\\alpha\\), this tells us what the sample distribution \\(f\\) will turn out to be. But we are interested in the reverse question: If we want to target a distribution \\(f\\), what proposal distribution \\(g\\) and acceptance function \\(\\alpha\\) do we need to get it?\nToday we look at how to do that with the “envelope” method.\nWe will start with a slightly different discussion, to try to motivate our approach. (If at any point you find this section confuses more than it helps, you can skip straight to the definition in the next section.)\nConsider a PDF \\(f\\), and draw \\(f\\) as a curve. We know that \\(f(x)\\) is always positive, so this curve is always above the x-axis. We also know that \\(\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} f(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = 1\\), so the total area under the curve is 1.\nSuppose we pick a point under the curve, uniformly at random, and then look at its x-coordinate \\(X\\). What is the PDF of \\(X\\)?\n[picture]\nWell, the probability that \\(X\\) lies in the interval \\([a,b]\\) is the probability the point we pick lies in the part of the curve between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), which is the area of that area divided by the total area under the curve 1. So \\[ \\mathbb P(a \\leq X \\leq b) = \\int_a^b f(x) \\,\\mathrm{d}x .\\] But that’s just the probability associated with the PDF \\(f\\), so \\(X\\) has PDF \\(f\\).\n[picture]\nThis gives us a way – in theory, at least – to sample from a PDF \\(f\\). Simply pick a point at random under the curve, and take its x-coordinate. Unfortunately, there is no known way to do this directly in general, so it doesn’t really help.\nHowever, suppose we could find a function \\(h\\) that (a) is positive everywhere, (b) has finite area under the curve, (c is above \\(f\\) everywhere, (d) and that we could sample a point under. We could call such a curve an envelope for \\(f\\). We could then propose a point picked at random under the envelope \\(h\\), reject it if it were above the curve \\(f\\), but accept it if it were under the curve \\(f\\). An accepted point would be uniform under the curve \\(f\\), so its x-coordinate would have PDF \\(f\\), as required.\n[picture]\nBut how can we find such an envelope \\(h\\) we can use?\nIf the area under the envelope \\(h\\) is \\(c\\), with \\(1 \\leq c &lt; \\infty\\) (the area must be at least 1, if the curve is above \\(f\\)), then \\(h\\) must be over the form \\(h(x) = cg(x)\\) for a PDF \\(g\\). But picking the x-coordinate point at random under \\(g\\) is just sampling from the random variable that has PDF \\(g\\). And the probability that a point with x-coordinate \\(x\\) from under the envelope \\(cg(x)\\) also lies under \\(f\\) is \\(f(x)/cg(x)\\), so that would be our acceptance probability.\nThis tells us how to perform envelope rejection sampling.",

We are going to set out the steps of the envelope rejection sampling algorithm.\n\n\nGoal: To sample from a random variable \\(X\\) with PDF \\(f\\).\nWe will need: A random variable \\(Y\\) with PDF \\(g\\) that we can sample from, and a finite constant \\(c\\) such that \\(f(x) \\leq cg(x)\\) for all \\(x\\).\nStep 1: Sample a proposal \\(Y\\) from the PDF \\(g\\).\nStep 2: Accept the proposal \\(Y\\) with probability \\(f(Y) / cg(Y)\\); otherwise reject \\(Y\\). If accepted, end. If rejected, go back to Step 1.\n\n\nNote that for given \\(f\\) and \\(g\\), there’s no guarantee a finite constant \\(c\\) exists such that \\(f(x) \\leq cg(x)\\). Informally, we need \\(g\\) to have tails that are “at least as heavy” as the tails of \\(f\\).\nWe should check this really does sample from \\(f\\). We saw last time that the PDF of a sample had PDF \\(f(x) \\propto g(x) \\,\\alpha(x)\\). Here, that is \\[ f(x) \\propto g(x)\\,\\frac{f(x)}{cg(x)} = \\frac1c\\,f(x) , \\] as required.\nIn envelope rejection sampling, we reject proposals \\(x\\) with probability \\(f(x)/cg(x)\\). But we saw last time that rejecting samples is bad – higher rejection probabilities leave us with fewer accepted samples (or requiring more proposals to get the same number of accepted samples). So, for given \\(f\\) and \\(g\\), it would be good to pick \\(c\\) as small as possible. We must have \\(f(x) \\leq cg(x)\\) for all \\(x\\), so we must have \\(c \\geq f(x) / g(x)\\) for all \\(x\\), and therefore \\(c \\geq \\sup_x f(x)/g(x)\\). (Here, “sup” means “supremum” – it’s like the maximum, except allows for the fact the maximum might only be achieved in a limit, such as \\(x \\to -\\infty\\) or \\(x \\to +\\infty\\).) The best possible \\(c\\), therefore is to take \\(c\\) to equal this maximum, \\(c = \\sup_x f(x) / g(x)\\), if it’s possible to calculate it.",

The von Mises distribution is used to model data on a circle, with \\(x\\) being the angle around the circle. Circular data might be a compass direction (north/south/east/west), or a time of day (with the circle representing the hours from midnight to midnight). The von Mises distribution is sort of a “circular equivalent” of the normal distribution on the line, with \\(m\\) being the mean value and \\(\\kappa\\) playing a similar role \\(1/\\sigma^2\\). There is no closed form for the constant of proportionality.\nWe wish to sample from the von Mises distribution with \\(m = 0\\) and \\(\\kappa = 2\\), where the unnormalised measure is \\(\\mu(x) = \\exp(2\\cos x)\\). We choose the uniform distribution \\(g(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\) on \\([0, 2\\pi)\\) for our envelope, which we can easily sample from as \\(Y = 2\\pi U\\). To choose \\(c\\), we note that the maximum of \\(\\mu(x)\\) is at \\(x = 0\\), where it takes the value \\(\\exp(2)\\). So we take \\(c = \\mu(0)/g(0) = 2\\pi\\mathrm{e}^2\\).\n\nmeas &lt;- function(x) exp(2 * cos(x))\nenv  &lt;- function(x) 2 * pi * exp(2) * (1 / (2 * pi)) * (x &lt;= 2 * pi)\n\n\n\nCode for drawing this graph\ncurve(\n  meas, n = 1001, from = 0, to = 2 * pi,\n  lwd = 3, col = \"blue\"\n)\ncurve(env, n = 1001, add = TRUE, lwd = 2, col = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(This graph might look a little odd, but remember that \\(0\\) and \\(2\\pi\\) are the same part of the circle, so this measure takes its largest values around that “join”.)\n\nn_prop &lt;- 1e6\nprops &lt;- 2 * pi * (runif(n_prop))\naccepts &lt;- props[runif(n_prop) &lt;= meas(props) / env(props)]\n\nlength(accepts)\n\n[1] 308512\n\nhist(accepts, probability = TRUE, breaks = 2 * pi * (0:30) / 30)\ncurve(meas(x) / 14.3, add = TRUE, lwd = 2, col = \"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe accepted about 31% of proposals.",

    "text": "16.3 Summary of Part II\nThis completes our study of random number generation. This would be a good time to summarise what we have learned.\nFirst we discussed generating randomness.\n\nWe can generate random numbers uniform on \\([0,1]\\) through true physical randomness or by a pseudorandom number generator.\nLCGs are one type of pseudorandom number generator. An LCG is a recurrence \\(x_{n+1} = (ax_n + c) \\bmod m\\).\nConditions for an LCG to have full period of \\(m\\) are given by the Hull–Dobell theorem: if \\(m\\) is a power of 2, then we need \\(c\\) to be odd and \\(a\\) to be \\(1 \\bmod 4\\). [Note: In the lecture, I wrongly said we need \\(c\\) to be even; in fact, we need \\(c\\) to be odd.]\n\nThen we discussed manipulating standard uniform samples into other distributions.\n\nThe inverse transform method uses the cumulative distribution function: set \\(U = F(X)\\) and invert to make \\(X\\) the subject.\nDiscrete random variables can be simulated by splitting up the intervals \\([0,1]\\) into segments of length \\(p(x_i)\\), then seeing which segment \\(U\\) falls into.\nTwo normal distributions can be sampled using the Box–Muller theorem and polar coordinates. Let \\(R\\) be Rayleigh distributed, \\(\\Theta\\) be uniform on \\([0, 2\\pi)\\), then set \\(X = R \\cos \\Theta\\) and \\(Y = R \\sin \\Theta\\).\nWe can also get different distributions by accepting a proposed sample \\(Y = x\\) from \\(g\\) with probability \\(\\alpha(x)\\). The PDF of an accepted sample is \\(f(x) \\propto \\alpha(x)\\,g(x)\\).\nEnvelope rejection sampling is a way to target rejection sampling a PDF \\(f\\), by choosing an “envelope” \\(cg(x)\\), and accepting a sample from \\(g\\) with probability \\(f(x)/cg(x)\\).\nRejection sampling works best when the acceptance probability is made as large as possible.\n\nNext time. We begin our study on MCMC: Markov chain Monte Carlo.\n\nSummary:\n\nEnvelope rejection sampling with envelope \\(cg(x)\\) has unconditional acceptance probability \\(1/c\\).\nEnvelope rejection sampling works even if the desired distribution is only know up to a proportionality constant.\n\nRead more: Voss, An Introduction to Statistical Computing, Subsections 1.4.2.",

You should work through all the questions on this problem sheet in advance of the problems class, which takes place in the lecture of Thursday 13 November.\nThis problem sheet is to help you practice material from the module and to help you check your learning. It is not for formal assessment and does not count towards your module mark.\nIf you want some brief informal feedback on Question 3 parts (a) and (b) and Question 6 (marked ★), you should submit your work electronically through Gradescope via the module’s Minerva page by 1400 on Tuesday 11 November. (If you hand-write solutions on paper, the easiest way to scan-and-submit that work is using the Gradescope app on your phone.) I will return some brief comments on your those two questions by the problems class on Thursday 13 November. Because this informal feedback, and not part of the official assessment, I cannot accept late work for any reason – but I am always happy to discuss any of your work on any question in my office hours.\nFull solutions will be released on Friday 14 November.\n\n\n\\[ \\]\n\n\n1.     Consider a discrete random variable that takes values \\(1, 2, 3, 4.5\\) with probabilities \\(0.2, 0.2, 0.5, 0.1\\) respectively. Write some R code that will sample from this distribution. (Your code may use the runif() function, but may not use the sample() function.) Check that a large sample from your code really does have the correct distribution.\n\nSolution. There are various ways to do this. With only four outcomes, you can just write a lot of this “by hand”, in a way that wouldn’t be practical if the range were very large, but it pretty easy to write – that’s what I did.\n\nrq1 &lt;- function(n) {\n  x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4.5)\n  prob &lt;- c(0.2, 0.2, 0.5, 0.1)\n  cumprob &lt;- cumsum(prob)\n  unif &lt;- runif(n)\n  ifelse(unif &lt;= cumprob[1], x[1],\n  ifelse(unif &lt;= cumprob[2], x[2],\n  ifelse(unif &lt;= cumprob[3], x[3], x[4])))\n}\n\n                Let’s test its accuracy by drawing a bar plot of a large sample.\n\nn &lt;- 1e6\nsamples &lt;- rq1(n)\nplot(table(samples) / n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Looks good to me.\n\n\n\n2.     The geometric distribution \\(X \\sim \\operatorname{Geom}(p)\\) represents the number of trials until the first success, where each trial succeeds independently with probability \\(p\\). The probability mass function of \\(X\\) is \\[ p(x) = (1-p)^{x-1}p \\qquad x = 1, 2, \\dots. \\]\n\n(a)  Show that the cumulative distribution function \\(F\\) of \\(X\\) is given by \\[ F(x) = 1 - (1-p)^x \\qquad x = 1, 2, \\dots .\\]\n\nSolution. I can think of two ways to do this. The first way is to just sum the probabilities, using the formula \\[ \\sum_{z=0}^{x-1} a^z = \\frac{1 - a^x}{1-a} \\] for the sum of a geometric progression. We have \\[ F(x) = \\sum_{y=1}^x (1-p)^{y-1} p = p \\sum_{z=0}^{x-1} (1-p)^z = p \\frac{1 - (1-p)^{x}}{1 - (1-p)} = 1 - (1-p)^x , \\] where in the second equality where shifted the index of the sum with \\(z = y-1\\).\nAlternatively (and, in my opinion, better) is to think about what the geometric distribution means. The geometric probability \\(p(x)\\) is the probability the first success occurs on the \\(x\\)th trial. So the complement of the CDF, \\(1 - F(x) = \\mathbb P(X &gt; x)\\) is the probability the first success happens after the \\(x\\)th trial, which is if and only if the first \\(x\\) trials are all failures. This is \\[ 1 - F(x) = \\mathbb P(X &gt; x) = (1-p)^x \\] because each of those \\(x\\) trials fails with probability \\(1 - p\\). This gives the answer.\n\n\n\n(b)  Write down a function – either in mathematical notation or in R code – that will transform a standard uniform random variable \\(U\\) into a geometric distribution. Try to make your function as simple as possible.\n\nSolution. The “dividing lines” between the segments come at the values \\(u\\) where \\(u = 1- (1-p)^x\\). Actually, since we’re trying to make the function simple, we could use \\(v = 1-u\\) (since one minus a standard uniform is still standard uniform), with dividing lines at \\(v = (1-p)^x\\), which corresponds to \\(x = \\log v / \\log(1-p)\\). So the segment corresponding to a uniformly distributed \\(v\\) will correspond to this value rounded up to the next integer.\nSo we can take \\(U \\sim \\operatorname{U}[0,1]\\), and put \\[ X = \\left\\lceil \\frac{\\log U}{\\log(1-p)} \\right\\rceil . \\]\nLet’s check this with R code\n\nrgeom2 &lt;- function(n, p) {\n  unif &lt;- runif(n)\n  ceiling(log(unif) / log(1 - p))\n}\n\nn &lt;- 1e6\np &lt;- 1/3\nsamples &lt;- rgeom2(n, p)\nplot(table(samples) / n, xlim = c(0, 10))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe could alternatively check the probabilities exactly.\n\ntrue &lt;- (1 - p)^{1:8 - 1} * p\nemp &lt;- table(samples)[1:8] / n\nround(rbind(true, emp), 4)\n\n          1      2      3      4      5      6      7      8\ntrue 0.3333 0.2222 0.1481 0.0988 0.0658 0.0439 0.0293 0.0195\nemp  0.3326 0.2222 0.1488 0.0989 0.0661 0.0435 0.0295 0.0195\n\n\nLooks good again.\n\n\n\n\n3.     Consider a Cauchy random variable \\(X\\) with probability density function \\[ f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\pi(1 + x^2)} .\\]\n\n(a)  ★Show that the cumulative distribution function of \\(X\\) is \\[ F(x) = \\frac12 + \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\arctan x \\]\n\nSolution. The CDF is \\[ \\begin{multline}\nF(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x f(y)\\,\\mathrm{d}y\n  = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^x \\frac{1}{1+y^2}\\,\\mathrm{d}y\n  = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\big[\\arctan y\\big]_{-\\infty}^x \\\\ = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\bigg( \\arctan x - \\Big(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\Big)\\bigg) = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\arctan x + \\frac12,\n\\end{multline}\\] since \\(\\lim_{y\\to-\\infty} \\arctan y = -\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\).\n\n\n\n(b)  ★Write down a function that will transform a standard uniform random variable \\(U\\) into a Cauchy distribution.\n\nSolution. We use the inverse transform method: write \\(U = F(X)\\) and invert. Here, we have \\[ U = \\frac12 + \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\arctan X .\\] Inverting gives \\[X = \\tan \\bigg(\\pi \\Big(U - \\frac12\\Big) \\bigg) .\\]\nThis can be interpreted as \\(X = \\tan\\Theta\\) where \\(\\Theta\\) is uniform between \\(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\).\n\n\n\n(c)  Using your answer to part (b), draw a histogram of samples from the Cauchy distribution in R.\n\nSolution. My function for generating samples is the following:\n\nrcauchy2 &lt;- function(n) {\n  unif &lt;- runif(n)\n  tan(pi * (unif - 1/2))\n}\n\nThe Cauchy distribution is a very heavy-tailed distribution. So to make the histogram look sensible, I’m going to throw away the occasional very large or very small sample. If I didn’t do this, the histogram would probably just look like a single spike at 0. (You of course shouldn’t do this when performing Monte Carlo estimation – those rare very large or very small samples can be extremely important in calculations!)\n\nn &lt;- 1e6\nsamples &lt;- rcauchy2(n)\n\nsamples_rest &lt;- samples[abs(samples) &lt; 12]\nhist(samples_rest, probability = TRUE, ylim = c(0, 0.33), breaks = 48)\ncurve(1 / (pi * (1 + x^2)), add = TRUE, n = 1001, lwd = 2, col = \"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.     Let \\(F\\) be a cumulative distribution function and \\(F^{-1}\\) its inverse.\n\n(a)  Prove that \\(F^{-1}\\) is a non-decreasing function.\n\nSolution. We recall the definition \\(F^{-1}(u) = \\min \\{x : F(x) \\geq u\\}\\). As \\(u\\) increases, the set \\(A_u = \\{x : F(x) \\geq u \\}\\) gets smaller – more specifically, for \\(u \\leq v\\), we have \\(A_u \\subseteq A_v\\). Hence the minimum of the set \\(A_u\\) cannot be larger than the minimum of the set \\(A_v\\). Hence \\(F^{-1}(u) = \\min A_u \\leq \\min A_v = F^{-1}(v)\\), as required.\n\n\n\n(b)  Show that \\(X = F^{-1}(U)\\) and \\(X' = F^{-1}(1-U)\\) have negative (or, rather, non-positive) correlation. You may use any results from the module, provided you state them clearly.\n\nSolutions. The relevant result here is Theorem 7.2. This said that if \\(\\phi\\) is an non-decreasing function, then \\(\\phi(U)\\) and \\(\\phi(1-U)\\) have covariance – and therefore correlation – less than or equal to 0. Here, we use \\(F^{-1}\\) as the function \\(\\phi\\).\n\n\n\n\n5.     Let \\(X \\sim \\operatorname{Beta}(3, 2)\\) be a Beta distribution with PDF \\[ f(x) = 12 x^2(1-x) \\qquad 0 \\leq x \\leq 1 . \\]\nShow how you could sample from \\(X\\) using envelope rejection sampling and an optimised value of the constant \\(c\\).\n\nSolution. The obvious suggestion here is to take \\(Y\\) uniformly distributed on \\([0, 1]\\), so \\(g(x) = 1\\) (although you don’t have to choose that).\nTo find the optimal value of \\(c\\), we consider the maximum of \\(f(x)\\). We can find that by differentiating \\[ f'(x) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x} (12x^2 - 12x^3) = (24x - 36x^2) , \\] so the maximum is at \\(x = \\frac23\\), where \\(f(x) = \\frac{16}{9}\\). Therefore, we take \\(c = \\frac{16}{9}\\).\nThus, our algorithm is to sample from a standard uniform, and then to accept with probability \\[ \\alpha(x) = \\frac{12x^2(1-x)}{\\frac{16}{9}} = \\frac{27}{4}\\,x^2(1-x) . \\]\n\n\n\n6.     ★ Consider sampling from the half-normal distribution \\[ f(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}} \\exp\\big(-\\tfrac12 x^2\\big) \\qquad x \\geq 0 \\] using envelope rejection sampling with an \\(\\operatorname{Exp}(\\lambda)\\) proposal distribution \\[g(x) = \\lambda \\mathrm{e}^{-\\lambda x} \\qquad x \\geq 0 .\\] You wish to design your envelope rejection sampling algorithm so that the acceptance probability is as high as possible.\n\n(a)  For fixed \\(\\lambda\\), show that the optimal value of \\(c\\) is \\[c = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}}\\,\\frac{\\exp(\\frac12\\lambda^2)}{\\lambda}.\\]\n\nSolution. This is very similar to Example 15.2 in Lecture 15. We have \\[ \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\frac{\\sqrt\\frac{2}{\\pi} \\exp(\\tfrac12 x^2)}{\\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda x)} = \\sqrt\\frac{2}{\\pi} \\,\\frac{\\exp \\big(-\\tfrac12 x^2 + \\lambda x\\big)}{\\lambda} . \\] We want to pick \\(c\\) to be the maximum value of this. The maximum occurs where \\(-\\frac12x^2 + \\lambda x\\) is maximised. By differentiating this and setting equal to 0, we get \\(-x + \\lambda = 0\\), so \\(x = \\lambda\\) and \\[ c =  \\sqrt\\frac{2}{\\pi} \\,\\frac{\\exp \\big(-\\tfrac12 \\lambda^2 + \\lambda^2\\big)}{\\lambda} =   \\sqrt\\frac{2}{\\pi} \\,\\frac{\\exp \\big(\\tfrac12 \\lambda^2\\big)}{\\lambda}, \\] as required.\n\n\n\n(b)  Show that the optimal value of \\(\\lambda\\) is \\(\\lambda = 1\\).\n\nSolution. Again, our goal is to choose \\(\\lambda\\) get \\(c\\) as small as possible, since \\(1/c\\) is the acceptance probability. Differentiating the expression from part (a) with respect to \\(\\lambda\\) gives \\[ \\frac{\\mathrm d}{\\mathrm d\\lambda} \\,c = \\sqrt\\frac{2}{\\pi} \\frac{\\exp \\big(\\tfrac12 \\lambda^2\\big)(\\lambda^2 - 1)}{\\lambda^2}.\\] This is 0 when \\(\\lambda^2 = 1\\), and since \\(\\lambda \\geq 0\\), the only solution is \\(\\lambda = 1\\). (This can be easily checked to be a minimum by looking at a sketch of \\(c\\) against \\(\\lambda\\), or differentiating twice, or just by thinking about the behaviour of \\(c\\) as a function of \\(\\lambda\\).)\n\n\n\n\n7.      [2016 exam, Question 1]  In this question, we consider generating samples from the distribution with probability density function \\[ f_a(x) = \\frac{1}{Z} \\,\\frac{1}{a(\\cos x + 1) + x^2} \\qquad x \\geq 1,\\] where \\(a\\) is a parameter and \\[Z = \\int_{1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{a(\\cos x + 1) + x^2}\\,\\mathrm{d}x \\] is a normalising constant.\n\n(a)  Introducing any notation you use, state the inverse transform method for random number generation.\n\nSolution. Fix a cumulative distribution function (CDF) \\(F(x) = \\mathbb P(X \\leq x)\\). The inverse CDF is defined to be \\(F^{-1}(u) = \\max \\{x : F(x) \\geq u\\}\\). We then have that \\(X = F^{-1}(U)\\) has CDF \\(F\\). We use this typically by writing \\(U = F(X)\\) and inverting to make \\(X\\) the subject.\n\n\n\n(b)  For \\(a = 0\\), explain how the inverse transform method can be used to generate samples with PDF \\(f_0\\).\n\nFor \\(a = 0\\), the PDF is \\[ f_0(x) = \\frac{1}{Z} \\,\\frac{1}{x^2} \\qquad x \\geq 1 .\\]\nWe should start by finding the normalising constant \\(Z\\): it’s \\[ Z = \\int_1^\\infty \\frac{1}{x^2}\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\big[-x^{-1}\\big]_1^\\infty = 0 -(-1) = 1 , \\] so the PDF is simply \\(f_0(x) = 1/x^2\\).\nNext, we want to find the CDF \\(F\\): it’s \\[ F(x) = \\int_1^x f_0(y)\\,\\mathrm{d}y = \\int_1^x \\frac{1}{y^2}\\,\\mathrm{d}y = \\big[-y^{-1}\\big]_1^x = 1 - \\frac{1}{x} . \\]\nFinally, to perform the inverse transform method, we write \\(U = F(X)\\) and invert. We have \\(U = 1 - 1/x\\), and so \\(X = 1/(1-U)\\).\n\n\n\n(c)  Introducing any notation you use, state the envelope rejection sampling method for random number generation.\n\n\n(d)  For \\(a &gt; 0\\), explain how the envelope rejection sampling method can be used to generate samples with PDF \\(f_a\\).\n\n\n(e)  How does the efficiency of your method in part (d) change as the value of \\(a\\) increases?

I used the R code\n\nn &lt;- 1e6\nsamples &lt;- runif(n, -1, 2)\nmean(samples^4)\n\n[1] 2.200859\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.      Let \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) both be standard normal distributions. Compute a Monte Carlo estimate of \\(\\Exg \\max\\{X,Y\\}\\). (You may wish to investigate R’s pmax() function.)\n\nSolution. By looking at ?pmax (or maybe searching on Google) I discovered that pmax() gives the “parallel maxima” of two (or more vectors). That is the first element is the maximum of all the first elements of the vectors; the second element is the maximum of all the second elements of the vectors; and so on.\nSo I used the R code\n\nn &lt;- 1e6\nxsamples &lt;- rnorm(n)\nysamples &lt;- rnorm(n)\nmean(pmax(xsamples, ysamples))\n\n[1] 0.5637339\n\n\n\n\n\n3.      You are trapped alone on an island. All you have with you is a tin can (radius \\(r\\)) and a cardboard box (side lengths \\(2r \\times 2r\\)) that it fits snugly inside. You put the can inside the box [left picture].\nWhen it starts raining, each raindrop that falls in the cardboard box might fall into the tin can [middle picture], or might fall into the corners of the box outside the can [right picture].\n\n\n(a)   Using R, simulate rainfall into the box. You may take units such that \\(r = 1\\). Estimate the probability \\(\\theta\\) that a uniformly-random raindrop that falls in the cardboard box falls into the tin can also.\n\nSolution. I set things up so that the box is \\([-1, 1]^2\\), centered at the origin. This means that the inside of the can is the set of points is those \\((x,y)\\) such that \\(x^2 + y^2 \\leq 1\\).\n\nn &lt;- 1e6\nrain_x &lt;- runif(n, -1, 1)\nrain_y &lt;- runif(n, -1, 1)\nin_box &lt;- function(x, y) x^2 + y^2 &lt;= 1\nmean(in_box(rain_x, rain_y))\n\n[1] 0.785823\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)   Calculate exactly the probability \\(\\theta\\).\n\nSolution. The area of the box is \\(2r \\times 2r = 4r^2\\). The area of the can is \\(\\pi r^2\\). So the probability a raindrop landing in the box lands in the can is \\[ \\frac{\\text{area of can}}{\\text{area of box}} = \\frac{\\pi r^2}{4r^2} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\approx 0.785. \\]\n\n\n\n(c)   You realise that, despite being trapped all alone on the island, you now have a way of approximating the value of \\(\\pi\\). If you want to calculate \\(\\pi\\) to 6 decimal places, roughly how many raindrops do you need to fall into the box?\n\nSolution. The phrase “to 6 decimal places” isn’t a precise mathematical one. I’m going to interpret this as getting the root-mean-square error below \\(10^{-6}\\). If you interpret it slightly differently that’s fine – for example, getting the width of a 95% confidence interval below \\(10^{-6}\\) could be another, slightly stricter, criterion.\nOne could work this out by hand. Since the variance of a Bernoulli random variable is \\(p(1-p)\\), the mean-square error of our estimator is \\[ \\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{4}(1 - \\frac{\\pi}{4})}{n} \\approx \\frac{0.169}{n} . \\] So we need \\[n = \\frac{0.169}{(10^{-6})^2} \\approx 169 \\text{ billion} . \\]\nThat said, if we are trapped on our desert island, maybe we don’t know what \\(\\frac{\\pi}{4}(1 - \\frac{\\pi}{4})\\) is. In that case we could do this using the can and the box. Our estimate of the variance is\n\nvar_est &lt;- var(in_box(rain_x, rain_y))\nvar_est / (1e-6)^2\n\n[1] 168305380974\n\n\nWe will probably spend a long time waiting for that much rain!\n\n\n\n\n4.     ★ (2024–25 exam, Question 1(d)) A statistician wants to estimate \\(\\mathbb E(\\cos X)\\), where \\(X \\sim \\operatorname{Exp(4)}\\) is an exponential distribution with rate 4. The statistician begins with a pilot study, as shown in the R session below:\n\n   &gt; n &lt;- 1e4\n&gt; samples &lt;- rexp(n, 4)\n&gt; var(cos(samples))\n[1] 0.01416\n\n            The statistician wants to get the root-mean-square error of her estimator down to \\(10^{−4}\\). Approximately how many samples will she need for the full study? Explain your answer.\n\n\n5.      Let \\(h(x) = 1/(x + 0.1)\\). We wish to estimate \\(\\int_0^5 h(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x\\) using a Monte Carlo method.\n\n(a)   Estimate the integral using \\(X\\) uniform on \\([0,5]\\).\n\nSolution.\n\nn &lt;- 1e6\nintegrand &lt;- function(x) 1 / (x + 0.1)\nsamples1 &lt;- runif(n, 0, 5)\nmean(5 * integrand(samples1))\n\n[1] 3.929335\n\n\n(In fact, the true answer is \\(\\log(5.1) - \\log(0.1) = 3.932\\), so it looks like this is working correctly.)\n\n\n\n(b)   Can you come up with a choice of \\(X\\) that improves on the estimate from (a)?\n\nSolution. Let’s look at a graph of the integrand \\(h\\).\n\n\nCode for drawing this graph\ncurve(\n  integrand, n = 1001, from = 0, to = 5,\n  col = \"blue\", lwd = 3,\n  xlab = \"x\", ylab = \"integrand h(x)\", xlim = c(0,5)\n)\nabline(h = 0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that we get a much bigger contribution to the integral from values near 0. So a random variable that picks values nearer to 0 more often might have a chance of giving a more accurate result.\n\nI decided to try an exponential distribution with rate 1, which should sample the smaller values of \\(x\\) more often.\n\npdf &lt;- function(x) dexp(x, 1)\nphi &lt;- function(x) (integrand(x) / pdf(x)) * (x &lt;= 5)\n\nsamples2 &lt;- rexp(n, 1)\nmean(phi(samples2))\n\n[1] 3.935744\n\n\n(I had to include x &lt;= 5 in the expression for \\(\\phi\\), because my exponential distribution will sometimes take samples above 5, but they should count as 0 in an estimate for the integral between 0 and 5.)\nTo see whether or not this was an improvement, I estimated the mean-square error.\n\nvar(5 * integrand(samples1)) / n\n\n[1] 3.361979e-05\n\nvar(phi(samples2)) / n\n\n[1] 6.073885e-06\n\n\nI found that I had reduced the mean-square error by roughly a factor of 5. \n\n\n\n\n\n6.      ★ Show that the indicator functions \\(\\mathbb I_A(X)\\) and \\(\\mathbb I_B(X)\\) have correlation 0 if and only if the events \\(\\{X \\in A\\}\\) and \\(\\{X \\in B\\}\\) are independent.\n\nSolution. Recall that two random variables \\(U\\), \\(V\\) have correlation 0 if and only if their covariance \\(\\Cov(U,V) = \\Ex UV - (\\Ex U)(\\Ex V)\\) is 0 too.\nWe know that \\(\\Exg\\Ind_A(X) = \\mathbb P(X \\in A)\\) and \\(\\Exg \\Ind_B(Y) = \\mathbb P(X \\in B)\\). What about \\(\\Exg \\Ind_A(X) \\Ind_B(X)\\)? Well, \\(\\Ind_A(x) \\Ind_B(x)\\) is 1 if and only if both indicator functions equal 1, which is if and only if both \\(x \\in A\\) and \\(x \\in B\\). So \\(\\Exg \\Ind_A(X) \\Ind_B(X) = \\mathbb P(X \\in A \\text{ and } X \\in B)\\).\nSo the covariance is \\[ \\Cov \\big(\\Ind_A(X), \\Ind_B(X) \\big) = \\mathbb P(X \\in A \\text{ and } X \\in B) - \\mathbb P(X \\in A)\\, \\mathbb P(X \\in B) . \\] If this is 0, then \\(\\mathbb P(X \\in A \\text{ and } X \\in B) = \\mathbb P(X \\in A)\\, \\mathbb P(X \\in B)\\), which is precisely the definition of those two events being independent.\n\n\n\n7.      Let \\(X\\) be an exponential distribution with rate 1.\n\n(a)   Estimate \\(\\mathbb EX^{2.1}\\) using the standard Monte Carlo method.\n\n\nn &lt;- 1e6\nsamples &lt;- rexp(n, 1)\nmean(samples^2.1)\n\n[1] 2.204066\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)   Estimate \\(\\mathbb EX^{2.1}\\) using \\(X^2\\) as a control variate. (You may recall that if \\(Y\\) is exponential with rate \\(\\lambda\\) then \\(\\mathbb EY^2 = 2/\\lambda^2\\).)\n\nSolution. We have \\(\\Ex X^2 = 2\\). So, re-using the same sample as before (you don’t have to do this – you could take new samples), our R code is as follows.\n\nmean(samples^2.1 - samples^2) + 2\n\n[1] 2.198793\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)   Which method is better?\n\nSolution. The better answer is the one with the smaller mean-square error.\nFor the basic method,\n\nvar(samples^2.1) / n\n\n[1] 2.82498e-05\n\n\nFor the control variate method,\n\nvar(samples^2.1 - samples^2) / n\n\n[1] 6.958636e-07\n\n\nSo the control variates method is much, much better.\n\n\n\n\n8.      ★ Let \\(Z\\) be a standard normal distribution. A statistician has been investigating Monte Carlo estimates of \\(\\mathbb EZ^k\\) for different positive integers values of \\(k\\). Her colleague suggests using \\(Z' = -Z\\) as an antithetic variable. Without running any R code, explain whether or not this is a good idea (a) when \\(k\\) is even; (b) when \\(k\\) is odd.\n\nSolution.\n(a) When \\(k\\) is even, we have \\(Z^k = (-Z)^k\\). So the antithetic variables method just repeats each sample twice. This is obviously no benefit at all, and just wastes time. Indeed, we have perfect positive correlation \\(\\rho = +1\\), which is the “worst-case scenario”.\n(b) When \\(k\\) is odd, we have \\(Z^k = -(-Z)^k\\). In this case we know that \\(\\Ex Z^k = 0\\), because the results for positive \\(z\\) exactly balance out those for negative \\(z\\), so no Monte Carlo sampling is necessary. If our statistician has somehow forgotten that, though, she will get a pleasant surprise! After just two samples, she will get the estimate \\[\\frac{1}{2} \\big(Z_1^k + (-Z_1)^k \\big) = \\frac{1}{2} (Z_1^k - Z_1^k) = 0 ,\\] Thereby getting the result exactly right. Indeed, we have perfect negative correlation \\(\\rho = -1\\), which is the “best-case scenario”.",

As suggested, we have \\[ \\theta = \\int_0^1 h(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_0^1 \\phi(x)\\,f(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\Exg \\phi(X) ,\\] where \\(X\\) is a random variable with PDF \\(f\\). To estimate this, we sample \\(X_1, \\dots, X_n\\) from \\(X\\), and use \\[ \\widehat\\theta_n^{\\mathrm{MC}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\phi(X_i) . \\]\n\n\n\n        ii.  Let \\(\\widehat\\theta_n\\) be the Monte Carlo estimate based on \\(n\\) simulations.

As in lectures, we have \\[ \\Exg \\theta_n^{\\mathrm{MC}} = \\Ex \\left(\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\phi(X_i) \\right) = \\frac{1}{n}\\,n\\Exg\\phi(X) = \\Exg\\phi(X) \\] and \\[ \\Var\\big((\\theta_n^{\\mathrm{MC}}\\big) = \\Var \\left(\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\phi(X_i) \\right) = \\frac{1}{n^2}\\,n\\Var\\big(\\phi(X)\\big) = \\frac{1}{n}\\Var\\big(\\phi(X)\\big) . \\]\n\n\n\n        iii.  What guidelines can be given for the choice of \\(f\\) in practice?\n\nSolution. First, \\(f\\) (or equivalently \\(X\\)) should be easy to sample from. Second, we want to minimise \\(\\Var(\\phi(X))\\), so should pick \\(f\\) approximately proportional to \\(h\\), so that \\(\\phi\\) is roughly constant, and therefore has low variance.\nIn the absence of better options, \\(X\\) being uniform on \\([0, 1]\\) (so \\(f(x) = 1\\) on this interval) is often not a bad choice.\n\n\n\n\n(b)  Consider evaluation the integral \\[ \\int_0^1 x^2\\,\\mathrm{d}x \\] by Monte Carlo integration using \\(f(x) = \\Ind_{[0,1]}(x)\\). Write down the Monte Carlo estimator \\(\\widehat\\theta_n\\).\n\nSolution. Since \\(f(x) = 1\\) on this interval, we must take \\(\\phi(x) = x^2\\). Thus the estimator is \\[\\widehat\\theta_n = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 ,\\] where \\(X_i \\sim \\operatorname{U}[0,1]\\) are independent.\n\n          Explain how antithetic variables can be used in this situation, and justify briefly why their use here is guaranteed to improve efficiency.\n\nSolution. Antithetic variables attempt to reduce the variance in Monte Carlo estimation by using pairs of variables \\((X_i, X'_i)\\) that both have the same distribution as \\(X\\), but where \\(\\phi(X)\\) and \\(\\phi(X')\\) are negatively correlated.\nIn this situation, if \\(X_i \\sim \\operatorname{U}[0,1]\\), then \\(X'_i = 1 - X_i\\) has this same distribution. The corresponding antithetic variable estimator is \\[\\widehat\\theta_n^{\\mathrm{AV}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n/2} \\big(X_i^2 + (1 - X_i)^2\\big) .\\]\nAn anitithetic variables estimator always decreases the variance of a Monte Carlo estimator if the correlation (or, equivalently, the covariance) between \\(\\phi(X)\\) and \\(\\phi(X')\\) is negative. We saw in lectures that, if \\(X \\sim \\operatorname{U}[0,1]\\) and \\(\\phi\\) is monotonically increasing, then \\(\\phi(X)\\) and \\(\\phi(1 - X)\\) have negative correlation. Since \\(x^2\\) is increasing on \\([0,1]\\), that is the case here.\n\n          For \\(U \\sim \\operatorname{U}[0,1]\\), use the results \\[\\Ex U^2 = \\tfrac13 \\qquad \\Ex U^4 = \\tfrac15 \\qquad \\Ex U^2(1-U)^2 = \\tfrac{1}{30} \\] to find the correlation between \\(U^2\\) and \\((1-U)^2\\). Hence, or otherwise, confirm that using antithetic variables reduces the variance of the Monte Carlo estimator by a factor of 8.\n\nSolution. We need to find the correlation between \\(U^2\\) and \\((1 - U)^2\\), where \\(U \\sim \\operatorname{U}[0,1]\\). The covariance is \\[ \\operatorname{Cov}\\big(U^2, (1-U)^2\\big)\n= \\Ex U^2(1-U)^2 - \\big(\\Ex U^2\\big) \\big(\\Ex (1-U)^2\\big)\n= \\tfrac{1}{30} - \\Big(\\tfrac{1}{3}\\Big)^2 = -\\tfrac{7}{90} .\\] The variance are both \\[ \\Var(U^2) = \\Ex U^4 - \\big(\\Ex U^2\\big)^2 = \\tfrac15 - \\Big(\\tfrac{1}{3}\\Big)^2 = \\tfrac{4}{45} . \\] Hence, the correlation is \\[ \\rho = \\operatorname{Corr}\\big(U^2, (1-U)^2\\big) = \\frac{-\\frac{7}{90}}{\\frac{4}{45}} = -\\tfrac78 . \\]\nThe variance of the standard Monte Carlo estimator is \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\Var(\\phi(X))\\), while the variance of the antithetic variables estimator is \\(\\frac{1+\\rho}{n}\\Var(\\phi(X))\\). So the variance changes by a factor of \\(1 + \\rho\\), which here is \\(1 - \\frac{7}{8} = \\frac{1}{8}\\). So the variance reduces by a factor of 8, as claimed.\n\n          (You may use without proof any results about the variance of antithetic variable estimates, but you should clearly state any results you are using.)\n\n\n\n2.     Let \\(X \\sim \\operatorname{N}(0,1)\\). Consider importance sampling estimation for the probability \\(\\theta = \\mathbb P(3 \\leq X \\leq 4)\\) using samples \\(Y_i\\) from the following sample distributions: (i) \\(Y \\sim \\operatorname{N}(1,1)\\); (ii) \\(Y \\sim \\operatorname{N}(2,1)\\); (iii) \\(Y \\sim \\operatorname{N}(3.5,1)\\); (iv) \\(Y \\sim 3 + \\operatorname{Exp}(1)\\).\nEach of these four distributions gives rise to a different importance sampling method.

To get the error to 1% means an absolute error of roughly \\(\\epsilon = 0.01\\widehat\\theta\\).

The basic Monte Carlo estimator is \\[ \\widehat\\theta_n^{\\mathrm{MC}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n\\phi(X_i) , \\] where the \\(X_i\\) are independent random samples from \\(X\\).\nThe basic importance sampling estimator is \\[ \\widehat\\theta_n^{\\mathrm{IS}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{f(Y_i)}{g(Y_i)} \\,\\phi(Y_i) , \\] where the \\(Y_i\\) are independent random samples from a random variable \\(Y\\) with probability density function \\(g\\). We must have \\(g(y) &gt; 0\\) whenever \\(f(y) &gt; 0\\).\nThe main advantage of the importance sampling estimator is that can reduce the variance of the estimator by oversampling the most important areas of \\(y\\), but then downweighting those samples. Another advantage is that importance sampling can be used when it is difficult to sample from \\(X\\).\n\n\n\n(b)  Prove that both the basic Monte Carlo and importance sampling estimates from part (a) are unbiased.\n\nSolution.

Using the result from part (c), or otherwise, show that in the case the variance of the importance sampling estimator \\(\\widehat\\theta_n^{\\mathrm{IS}}\\) is given by \\[ \\Var\\big(\\widehat\\theta_n^{\\mathrm{IS}}\\big) = \\frac{\\exp(\\mu^2 - a\\mu) - \\theta^2}{n} . \\]\n\nSolution. It’s clear, using part (c), that it will suffice to show that \\[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\frac{f(y)^2 \\phi(y)^2}{g(y)}\\,\\mathrm{d}y = \\exp(\\mu^2 - a\\mu) . \\] Here, we have \\[ \\begin{align}\nf(y) &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi}} \\exp\\big(-\\tfrac14 y^2 \\big) \\\\\ng(y) &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\big(-\\tfrac12 (y-\\mu)^2 \\big) \\\\\n\\phi(y) &= \\sqrt{2} \\exp\\big(-\\tfrac14 (y-a)^2 \\big) .\n\\end{align} \\] Therefore, by a long and painful algebra slog, we have \\[ \\begin{align}\n\\frac{f(y)^2 \\phi(y)^2}{g(y)} &= \\frac{\\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\exp\\big(-\\tfrac12 y^2 \\big)\\times 2\\exp\\big(-\\tfrac12 (y-a)^2 \\big)}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\big(-\\tfrac12 (y-\\mu)^2 \\big)} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp \\Big(-\\tfrac12 \\big(y^2 + (y-a)^2 - (y-\\mu)^2 \\big)\\Big) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp \\Big(-\\tfrac12 \\big(y^2 - 2(a - \\mu)y + a^2 + \\mu^2\\big)\\Big) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp \\Big(-\\tfrac12 \\big((y - (a - \\mu))^2 - (a- \\mu)^2 + a^2 - \\mu^2\\big)\\Big) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp \\Big(-\\tfrac12 \\big((y - (a - \\mu))^2 + 2a\\mu - 2\\mu^2 \\big)\\Big) \\\\\n&=  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp \\Big(-\\tfrac12 \\big(y - (a - \\mu)\\big)^2\\Big)\\exp(\\mu^2 + a\\mu),\n\\end{align} \\] where we ‘completed the square’ on the fourth line. Thus \\[ \\begin{align}\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\frac{f(y)^2 \\phi(y)^2}{g(y)}\\,\\mathrm{d}y\n&= \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp \\Big(-\\tfrac12 \\big(y - (a - \\mu)\\big)^2\\Big)\\exp(\\mu^2 + 2a) \\,\\mathrm{d}y\\\\\n&= \\exp(\\mu^2 + 2a) \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp \\Big(-\\tfrac12 \\big(y - (a - \\mu)\\big)^2\\Big)\\,\\mathrm{d}y \\\\\n&= \\exp(\\mu^2 - a\\mu) ,\n\\end{align} \\] since the big integral on the right is the integral of the PDF of a normal \\(\\operatorname{N}(a-\\mu, 1)\\) distribution, so equals 1.\nHence, we have proved the result.\n\n          For fixed \\(n\\) and \\(a\\), find the value of \\(\\mu\\) for which the importance sampling estimator has the smallest mean-square error. Comment on the result.\n\nSolution. Minimising this expression is equivalent to minimising \\(\\mu^2 + a\\mu\\). By differentiating with respect to \\(\\mu\\) (or otherwise), we see that this is at \\(a = 2 \\mu\\) or \\(\\mu = \\frac12 a\\).\n\n\n\n\n4.     (Answer the following question “by hand”, without using R. You may check your answer with R, if you wish.)\n\n(a)  Consider the LCG with modulus \\(m = 2^4 = 16\\), multiplier \\(a = 5\\), and increment \\(a = 8\\). What is the period of this LCG when started from the seed (i) \\(x_1 = 1\\); (ii) \\(x_1 = 2\\)?\n\nSolution. For (i), we have \\[ \\begin{align}\nx_1 &= 1 \\\\\nx_2 &= (5 \\times 1 + 8) \\bmod 16 = 13 \\bmod 16 = 13 \\\\\nx_3 &= (5 \\times 13 + 8) \\bmod 16 = 73 \\bmod 16 = 9 \\\\\nx_4 &= (5 \\times 9 + 8) \\bmod 16 = 53 \\bmod 16 = 5 \\\\\nx_5 &= (5 \\times 5 + 8) \\bmod 16 = 33 \\bmod 16 = 1 .\n\\end{align}\\] Here, \\(x_5\\) is a repeat of \\(x_1\\), so the period is \\(5-1=4\\).\nFor (ii), we have \\[ \\begin{align}\nx_1 &= 2 \\\\\nx_2 &= (5 \\times 2 + 8) \\bmod 16 = 18 \\bmod 16 = 2 .\n\\end{align}\\] This is an immediate repeat, so the period is 1.\n\n\n\n(b) Consider the LCG with modulus \\(m = 2^4 = 16\\), multiplier \\(a = 2\\), and increment \\(c = 4\\). Start from the seed \\(x_1 = 3\\). (i) When do we first see a repeat output? (ii) What is the period?\n\nSolution. We have \\[ \\begin{align}\nx_1 &= 3 \\\\\nx_2 &= (2 \\times 3 + 4) \\bmod 16 = 10 \\bmod 16 = 10 \\\\\nx_3 &= (2 \\times 10 + 4) \\bmod 16 = 24 \\bmod 16 = 8 \\\\\nx_4 &= (2 \\times 8 + 4) \\bmod 16 = 20 \\bmod 16 = 4 \\\\\nx_5 &= (2 \\times 4 + 4) \\bmod 16 = 12 \\bmod 16 = 12 \\\\\nx_6 &= (2 \\times 12 + 4) \\bmod 16 = 28 \\bmod 16 = 12 .\n\\end{align}\\]\n(i) The first repeat is \\(x_6\\).\n(ii) Since 12 is a fixed point of this LCG, the remainder of the sequence is 12 forever, with period 1.\n\n\n\n\n5.     Consider the following LCGs with modulus \\(m = 2^8 = 256\\):\n (i) \\(a = 31\\), \\(c = 47\\);\n (ii) \\(a = 21\\), \\(c = 47\\);\n (iii) \\(a = 129\\), \\(c = 47\\).\n\n(a)  Without using a computer, work out which of these LCGs have a full period of 256.\n\nSolution.\n (i) Here, \\(a\\) is \\(3 \\bmod 4\\), not \\(1 \\bmod 4\\), so this does not have full period of 256.\n (ii) Here, \\(c\\) is odd and \\(a\\) is \\(1 \\bmod 4\\), so this does have full period of 256.\n (iii) Here, \\(c\\) is odd and \\(a\\) is \\(1 \\bmod 4\\), so this does have full period of 256.\n\n\n\n(b)  Which of these LCGs would make good pseudorandom number generators?\n\nSolution. We will check the random appearance of the outputs using R.\n\nlcg &lt;- function(n, modulus, mult, incr, seed) {\n  samples &lt;- rep(0, n)\n  samples[1] &lt;- seed\n  for (i in 1:(n - 1)) {\n    samples[i + 1] &lt;- (mult * samples[i] + incr) %% modulus\n  }\n  return(samples)\n}\n\n (i) This does not have full period, so is unlikely to be good PRNG. Let’s check\n\nm &lt;- 2^8\nseed &lt;- 1\nplot(lcg(m, m, 31, 47, seed))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe picture confirms that this does not look random, and in fact has very short period of 16.\n (ii) This does have full period, so is a candidate for a good PRNG if the output looks random.\n\nplot(lcg(m, m, 21, 47, seed))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis mostly looks random, but there does appear to be a sort of thick diagonal line in the picture going from bottom left to rop right. I’d might be happy to use this for casual statistical work – the lack of randomness does not seem super-serious – but I would avoid this for cryptographic purposes, for example.\n (iii) This does have full period, so is a candidate for a good PRNG if the output looks random.\n\nplot(lcg(m, m, 129, 47, seed))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though this has full period, there is a very clear non-random pattern. This is not appropriate for a PRNG.\n\n\n\n\n6.     Consider an LCG with modulus \\(m = 2^{10} = 1024\\), multiplier \\(a = 125\\), and increment \\(c = 5\\). Using R:\n\n(a) Generate 1000 outputs in \\(\\{0, 1, \\dots, 1023\\}\\) from this LCG, starting with the seed \\(x_1 = 1\\).\n\nSolution. Using the same lcg() function from Question 5, we have\n\nn &lt;- 1000\nm &lt;- 2^{10}\nseed &lt;- 1\nsamples1 &lt;- lcg(n, m, 125, 5, seed)\n\n\n\n\n(b)  Convert these to 1000 outputs to pseudorandom uniform samples in \\([0, 1]\\).\n\nTo do this, we simply divide the samples by \\(m\\).\n\nsamples1 &lt;- samples1 / m\n\n\n\n\n(c)  Using these samples, obtain a Monte Carlo estimate for \\(\\mathbb E\\cos(U)\\), where \\(U \\sim \\operatorname{U}[0,1]\\).\n\nSolution.\n\nmean(cos(samples1))\n\n[1] 0.8418218\n\n\nThis is very close to the correct answer \\(\\sin 1 = 0.8414\\)\n\n\n\n(d)  What is the root-mean-square error of your estimate?\n\nSolution.\n\nsqrt(var(cos(samples1)) / n)\n\n[1] 0.004392217\n\n\n\n\n\n(e)  Repeat parts (a) to (d) for the LCG with the same \\(m\\), but now with multiplier \\(a = 127\\) and increment \\(c = 4\\).\n\nSolution.\n\nsamples2 &lt;- lcg(n, m, 127, 4, seed)\nsamples2 &lt;- samples2 / m\nmean(cos(samples2))\n\n[1] 0.868257\n\nsqrt(var(cos(samples2)) / n)\n\n[1] 0.003899394\n\n\nThis does not seem to be quite accurate to the answer to \\(\\sin 1 = 0.841\\), and the reported RMSE to too small to account for the error.\nHowever, the problem is that this LCG is not actually a uniform (pseudo)random number generator – it has period 8.\n\nplot(samples2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus the estimator is just keeping using the same 8 points over and over again. So this is actually estimating \\(\\mathbb E(\\cos Y)\\), where \\(Y\\) is uniform on the 8 points actually visited by the LCG. So while the correct answer is \\(\\mathbb EU = \\sin 1 = 0.841\\), this is in fact estimating \\[ \\begin{multline}\n\\frac{1}{8} \\bigg(\\cos \\frac{1}{2^{10}} + \\cos \\frac{131}{2^{10}} + \\cos \\frac{257}{2^{10}} + \\cos \\frac{899}{2^{10}} \\\\\n+ \\cos \\frac{513}{2^{10}} + \\cos \\frac{643}{2^{10}} + \\cos \\frac{769}{2^{10}} + \\cos \\frac{387}{2^{10}}\\bigg) = 0.868\n\\end{multline} \\] (where the numerators are the 8 values visited by the LCG), which is not the correct answer.",
